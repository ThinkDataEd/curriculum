The Mobilize curricula center around Participatory Sensing campaigns, through which students use their mobile devices to collect and share data about their community and their lives, and analyze these data to gain a greater understanding about their world. Mobilize broke barriers by teaching students to apply concepts and practices from computer science and statistics to learning science and mathematics, and it was uniquely dynamic in that each Mobilize class collects its own data, and each class has the opportunity to make unique discoveries. Across all Mobilize curricula, mobile devices are used not as gimmicks to capture students' attention, but as legitimate tools that bring scientific enquiry into their everyday lives. From 2011 to 2014, the Mobilize grant funded summer institutes for LAUSD high school mathematics, science, and computer science teachers to learn to use the Participatory Sensing (PS) methods, tools, and materials to deepen their knowledge of computer science (CS) concepts and to support student CS, math, and science learning.</p> <p>First implemented in 2014 under the auspices of the Mobilize grant, Introduction to Data Science (IDS) began as a pilot program with 10 LAUSD mathematics teachers. Since, the IDS curriculum has been offered across the United States and internationally.

Data are everywhere, and this curriculum will help prepare students to live in a world of data. The curriculum focuses on practical applications of data analysis to give students concrete and applicable skills. Instead of using small, tailored, curated datasets as in a traditional statistics curriculum, this curriculum engages students with a wider world of data that fall into the \"Big Data\" paradigm and are relevant to students' lives. In contrast to the traditional formula-based approach, in IDS, statistical inference is taught algorithmically, using modern randomization and simulation techniques. Students will learn to find and communicate meaning in data, and to think critically about arguments based on data.</p> <p>This curriculum was developed in partnership with the Los Angeles Unified School District for a culturally, linguistically, and socially diverse group of students. Upon first publication of the IDS curriculum in 2015, the district-wide student ethnicities included .3% American Indian, 3.7% Asian, .4% Pacific Islander, 2.3% Filipino, 73.0% Latino, 10.9% African American, 8.8% White, and .6% other/multiple responses.

Finkle and Torp (1955) define Project-Based Learning (PBL) as a curriculum development and instructional system that simultaneously develops both problem-solving strategies and disciplinary knowledge bases and skills by placing students in the active role of problem solvers confronted with an ill-structured problem that mirrors real-world problems. PBL, therefore, is a model for teaching and learning that focuses on the main concepts and principles of a discipline, involves students in problem-solving investigations and other meaningful tasks, allows students to construct their own knowledge through inquiry, and culminates in a project.</p> <p>Because IDS is a mathematical science, the BSCS 5-E Instructional Model provides a planned sequence of instruction that places students at the center of their learning experiences. This model encourages students to explore, create their own meaning of concepts, and relate their understanding to other concepts. The units in IDS contain lessons that, together, fit the 5-E Instructional Model:</p> Stage of Inquiry in an Inquiry-Based Science Program Possible Student Behavior Possible Teacher Strategy Engage Asks questions such as, Why did this happen? What do I already know about this? What can I find out about this? How can I solve this problem? Shows interest in the topic. Creates interest. Generates curiosity. Raises questions and problems. Elicits responses that uncover student knowledge about the concept/topic. Explore Thinks creatively within the limits of the activity. Tests predictions and hypotheses. Forms new predictions and hypotheses. Tries alternatives to solve a problem and discusses them with others. Records observations and ideas. Suspends judgment. Tests ideas. Encourages students to work together without direct instruction from the teacher. Observes and listens to students as they interact. Asks probing questions to redirect students' investigations when necessary. Provides time for students to puzzle through problems. Acts as a consultant for students. Explain Explains their thinking, ideas, and possible solutions or answers to other students. Listens critically to other students' explanations. Questions other students' explanations. Listens to and tries to comprehend explanations offered by the teacher. Refers to previous activities. Uses recorded data in explanations. Encourages students to explain concepts and definitions in their own words. Asks for justification (evidence) and clarification from students. Formally provides definitions, explanations, and new vocabulary. Uses students' previous experiences as the basis for explaining concepts. Elaborate Applies scientific concepts, labels, definitions, explanations, and skills in new, but similar situations. Uses previous information to ask questions, propose solutions, make decisions, and design experiments. Draws reasonable conclusions from evidence. Records observations and explanations. Expects students to use vocabulary, definitions, and explanations provided previously in new context. Encourages students to apply the concepts and skills in new situations. Reminds students of alternative explanations. Refers students to alternative explanations. Evaluate Checks for understanding among peers. Answers open-ended questions by using observations, evidence, and previously accepted explanations. Demonstrates an understanding or knowledge of the concept or skill. Evaluates his or her own progress and knowledge. Asks related questions that would encourage future investigations. Refers students to existing data and evidence and asks, What do you know? Why do you think...? Observes students as they apply new concepts and skills. Assesses students' knowledge and/or skills. Looks for evidence that students have changed their thinking. Allows students to assess their learning and group process skills. Asks open-ended questions such as, Why do you think...? What evidence do you have? What do you know about the problem? How would you answer the question? <p>IDS is designed to develop students' computational and statistical thinking skills. Computationally, students will learn to write code to enhance analyses of data, to break large problems into smaller pieces, and to understand and employ algorithms to solve problems. Statistical thinking skills include developing a data \"habit of mind\" in which one learns to seek data to answer questions or support (or undermine) claims; thinking critically about the ability of particular data to support claims; learning to interpret analyses of data; and learning to communicate findings.</p> <p>IDS employs Participatory Sensing to give students control of the data collection process, and to enable them to collect data about things that are important to them. The curriculum is organized around a series of Participatory Sensing \"campaigns\" in which students engage in all stages of the statistical process, which we call the Data Cycle: asking questions, examining and collecting data, analyzing data, interpreting data and, if necessary, beginning again. As students progress, they engage in the Data Cycle in a deeper way. Initially, analysis and interpretation is purely descriptive. Later, randomization-based algorithms and simulations are used to develop notions of inference and to make students more critical of the data collection process. By engaging in the Data Cycle repeatedly in different contexts - some of which include the students' own designs - students will learn to think like data scientists.</p>"},{"location":"overview/#student-team-collaboration","title":"Student Team Collaboration","text":"<p>Many of the activities in the IDS curriculum are based on students collaborating with each other. Activities may call on pairs or teams of students. It is imperative that teams and team roles be established as close to the beginning of the course as possible. Expectations about teamwork should be introduced as soon as teams are formed. The ideal team comprises four students. The Teacher Resources section provides a list of instructional strategies and a description of team roles to use for effective student team collaboration. If student teams are unfamiliar with these instructional strategies, it is important for the instructor to take the time to model each strategy.</p>"},{"location":"overview/#classroom-discussions","title":"Classroom Discussions","text":"<p>Because this is an inquiry-based curriculum, classroom discussion will be especially important. It is important to set classroom discussion norms from the beginning of the course. All students should be encouraged to contribute to the classroom discussion, and the learning environment should be as non-judgmental and as open as possible. Instead of one right answer, most questions in this class have many right answers. In fact, even yes/no questions could have two right answers, both with valid supporting evidence. Teachers should create an environment to help students hold each other accountable so that all voices are heard, meaning that if there are a few students who tend to share a lot, invite them to encourage their peers so other voices can be heard. If there are students who tend to avoid contributing to the class discussion, encourage them to share so that their voices are heard.</p>"},{"location":"overview/#assignments-homework","title":"Assignments &amp; Homework","text":"<p>As much as possible, IDS work will take place in the classroom. Lessons are designed for a 50-60 minute class period. Classes on block schedule will need to complete two lessons; however, it is up to the teacher to decide where to stop in each lesson. There will be open-ended assignments that are sent home. Assignments that require the computer will be completed in class, to avoid the assumption that students have access to computers at home. The exception to this is if a student misses lab time, in which case they will need to find a time to complete the assignment outside of class. As discussed in the software section above, they can use an Internet-enabled computer to do their make-up work.</p> <p>IDS assignments will not be drill-based. Instead, they will follow the inquiry-based instructional model. Again, most questions will not have one right answer. Instead, students will learn to support their claims with evidence and to participate in data-based discussions. Newspaper or other periodical or digital articles are available via links in the lessons. If desired, articles may be downloaded and printed. On average, students will complete a lab assignment in RStudio approximately once per week. It will be at the discretion of the teacher whether or not to collect lab assignments. Calculators should be available every day for students to use.</p> <p>Every day, students will be expected to bring their Data Science (DS) journal, a notebook where they record their notes, work on small assignments, and sketch plots. Teachers may choose to check DS journals and other assignments in the curriculum for credit. End of Unit Projects, oral presentations, and Practicums are designed as application exercises. Scoring guides are provided as an aid for student performance expectations. It will be up to the teacher to score or attach a grade to these assignments.</p>"},{"location":"overview/#overview-of-instructional-topics","title":"Overview of Instructional Topics","text":"<p>The purpose of IDS is to introduce students to dynamic data analysis. The four major components of this curriculum are based on the conceptual categories called upon by the Common Core State Standards High School - Statistics and Probability:</p> <ul> <li>I. Interpreting Categorical and Quantitative Data</li> <li>II. Making Inferences and Justifying Conclusions</li> <li>III. Conditional Probability and the Rules of Probability</li> <li>IV. Using Probability to Make Decisions</li> </ul> <p>IDS will emphasize the use of statistics and computation as tools for creative work, and as a means of telling stories with data. Seen in this way, its content will also prepare students to \"read\" and think critically about existing data stories. Ultimately, this course will be about how we discern good stories from bad through a practice that involves compiling evidence from one or more sources, and which often requires hands-on examination of one or more datasets.</p> <p>IDS will develop the tools, techniques, and principles for reasoning about the world with data. It will present a process that is iterative and authentically inquiry-based, comparing multiple \"views\" of one or more datasets. Inevitably, these views are the result of some kind of computation, producing numerical summaries or graphical displays. Their interpretation relies on a special kind of computation known as simulation to describe the uncertainty in each view. This kind of reasoning is exploratory and investigatory, sometimes framed as hypothesis evaluation, and sometimes as hypothesis generation.</p>"},{"location":"overview/#interpreting-categorical-and-quantitative-data","title":"Interpreting Categorical and Quantitative Data","text":"<p>A handful of data interpretations are standard. Some, including summaries of shape, center, and spread of one or more variables in a dataset - as well as graphical displays like histograms and scatterplots - are standard in the sense that they provide interpretable information in a number of research contexts. They are portable from one set of data to the next, and the rules for their use are simple. And yet, our interpretation of data is rarely \u201cstandard.\u201d Data have no natural look - even a spreadsheet or a table of numbers embeds within it a certain representational strategy. We construct multiple views of data in an attempt to uncover stories about the world.</p> <p>In addition to numerical data, this course will consider time, location, text, and image as data types, and will examine views that uncover patterns or stories. Throughout the course, simulation will be used to calibrate our interpretation of a view, or of a numerical or graphical summary, so that we understand what \u201cstory-less\u201d data (i.e., pure noise, no association) look like.</p> <p>In addition to summaries and simple graphics, students will engage in a modeling practice aligned with the CCSS mathematical practices in order to learn how statistical analyses can explain and describe real-world phenomena. Students will practice fitting and evaluating standard mathematical and statistical models, such as the least-squares regression line. Modeling comes into play when students are asked to design and implement probabilistic simulations in order to test and compare hypothetical chance processes to real-world data.</p>"},{"location":"overview/#making-inferences-and-justifying-conclusions","title":"Making Inferences and Justifying Conclusions","text":"<p>Data are becoming increasingly plentiful, supported by a host of new \"publication\" techniques or services. Post-Web 2.0, data are interoperable, flowing out of one service and into another, helping us easily build a detailed data version of many phenomena in the world. Reasoning with data, then, starts with the sources and the mechanics of this flow. Which sources do we trust? How do data from different organizations compare? What stories have been told previously with these data, and by whom?</p> <p>This course answers these questions, in part, by using the tools and techniques already mentioned. The ability to read and critique published stories and visualizations are additions to these tools and techniques. Finally, as an act of comparison, students should also be able to formulate questions, identify existing datasets, and evaluate how the new stories stack up against the old. To support this cycle of inquiry, students will examine the basic publication mechanisms for data and develop a set of questions to ask of any data source - computation meets critical thinking. In some cases, data will exhibit special structures that can be used to aid in inference. The simulation techniques for calibrating different views of a dataset take on new life when some form of random process was followed to generate the data. Polls, for example, rely on random samples of the population, and clinical trials randomly assign patients to treatment and control groups. A simulation strategy that repeats these random mechanisms can be used to assess uncertainty in the data, assigning a margin of error to poll results, or identifying new drugs that have a \"significant\" effect on some health outcome.</p> <p>In many cases, data will not possess this kind of special origin story. A census, for example, is meant to be a complete enumeration of a population, and we can reason in a very direct way from the data. In other cases, no formal principle was applied, perhaps being a sample \"of convenience.\" The techniques for telling stories from these kinds of data will also rely on a mix of simulation and subsetting. Finally, this course will introduce Participatory Sensing as a technique for collecting data. The idea of a data collection campaign will be introduced as a means of formalizing a question to be addressed with data. Campaigns will be informed by research and data analysis, and will build on, augment, or challenge existing sources. The \"culture\" behind the existing sources and the summaries or views they promote will be part of the classroom discussions.</p> <p>It is worth noting that everything described so far depends on computation, using a piece of statistical software on a computer. Students will be taught simple programming tools for accessing data, creating views or fitting models, and then assessing their importance via simulation. Computation becomes a medium through which students learn about data. The more expressive the language, the more elaborate the stories we can tell.</p>"},{"location":"overview/#probability","title":"Probability","text":"<p>Since simulation is our main tool for reasoning with data, interpreting the output of simulations requires understanding some basic rules of probability. First and foremost, this course will discuss the ways in which a computer can generate random phenomena (e.g., How does a computer toss a coin?). Simple probability calculations will be used to describe what we expect to see from random phenomena, then students will compare their results to simulations. The point is to both rehearse these basic calculations and to make a formal tie between simulation and theory in simple cases.</p> <p>In that vein, this course will motivate the relationship between frequency and probability. Students will essentially be simulating independent trials and creating summaries of those simulations. In turn, they should understand that the frequency with which an event occurs in a series of independent simulations tends to the probability for that event as the number of simulations gets large (the Law of Large Numbers, a topic that is often taught in introductory statistics courses).</p> <p>From here, students will simulate a variety of random processes to aid in formal statistical inference when some random mechanism was applied as part of the data design. In short, probability becomes a ruler of sorts for assessing the importance of any story we might tell. In this approach to probability, a combination of direct mathematical calculation and computer simulations will be used in order to give students a deep sense of the underlying statistical concepts.</p>"},{"location":"overview/#topic-outline","title":"Topic Outline","text":"<p>This outline describes only the scope of the course; the sequence is described in each unit.</p>"},{"location":"overview/#i-interpreting-data","title":"I.

Our world has become increasingly data-centric, and we are constantly generating data, whether we know it or not. From posts on Facebook, to shopping records created when you swipe your credit card, to driving over sensors embedded in highway on-ramps, we leave behind a stream of data wherever we go. These data are used to generate stories about our world, whether it is for political forecasting, marketing, scientific research, or even Netflix recommendations.

This activity also develops computational thinking by teaching students about some basic programming structures. Then, the use of models will come to the foreground. Students will be introduced to linear models - the most common form of modeling in introductory statistics classes - which will serve as the foundation to learn more complex modeling techniques that use the computer technology available to them later in the course, including smoothing techniques and tree-based models.</p>"},{"location":"scope/#focus-statistics-ccss-m_1","title":"Focus Statistics CCSS-M","text":"<p>S-ID 2: Use statistics appropriate to the shape of the data distribution to compare center (median, mean) and spread (interquartile range, standard deviation) of two or more different data sets.</p> <p>S-ID 3: Interpret differences in shape, center, and spread in the context of the data sets, accounting for possible effects of extreme data points (outliers).</p> <p>S-ID 4.

Participatory Sensing is a unique data collection method because it uses sensors. Furthermore, this method emphasizes the involvement of citizens and community groups in the process of sensing and documenting where they live, work, and play. Triggers play an important role in the Participatory Sensing data collection process. The response to the triggers may or may not be the same each time.

Statistical questions are questions that address variability and are productive in that they motivate data collection, analysis, and interpretation.

Giving clear, concise instructions to others is an important skill for students to learn. In this activity, students will practice using descriptive vocabulary, communicating ideas to others, recognizing steps in a process, and recognizing the importance of the use of clear language.</p> </li> <li> <p>Prepare for this task by gathering the necessary materials for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and arranging them in a way that makes them easy to use. You may want to wear an apron and have a trash bag smock \u2014 this can get messy but that\u2019s most of the fun!</p> <p>Note: Be aware of peanut allergies! If any of your students are allergic to peanut butter, DO NOT ALLOW STUDENTS TO HANDLE THE PEANUT BUTTER! Peanut allergies can be very serious and children can have reactions without even eating it. So be aware and be careful!</p> </li> <li> <p>Ask your students if they have ever followed a recipe before.</p> <ol> <li> <p>What kinds of things have they made?</p> </li> <li> <p>Does anyone know how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?</p> </li> <li> <p>Would they teach you how?</p> </li> <li> <p>Would they give you all the steps to make a sandwich?</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Show your students the materials you have for making a sandwich. Have students take out paper and pencils and ask each student (or pair of students) to write down their instructions for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. We can also call these instructions an algorithm.</p> </li> <li> <p>Explain to students that precise instructions for any process are like a formula to follow in order to get the same results each time. Also, an algorithm is how we communicate with the computer. The teacher will function as the computer. Your job is to give him/her rules so that he/she can carry out and successfully make a PB&amp;J sandwich.</p> </li> <li> <p>Every algorithm needs input and produces output. The output here will be a PB&amp;J sandwich. What is the input? Answer: Steps, or actions to follow.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tell students that when they are done you will select someone to share their instructions and you will make a sandwich following the instructions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Select a student to read their instructions, and do EXACTLY what it says. For example, if it says \u201cput the peanut butter on the bread,\u201d you can literally put the jar of peanut butter on the bag of bread. There was no instruction to open the bread or the jar of peanut butter, no instruction to use the knife in any way, etc. Listen for other examples of unclear instructions and think of how you might act them out. If students are not clear about where to spread the peanut butter, put it on the crust. The more literal you are by doing exactly what the instructions say, the funnier the activity will be and the more likely you are to get your point across about the importance of clear instructions.</p> </li> <li> <p>After your first sandwich, ask your students if they think their instructions were clear or not. What are some things they might have done differently?</p> </li> <li> <p>Select another student to read his/her instructions. They will be sure to use clarifications of the instructions you acted upon before - this is a good thing!</p> </li> <li> <p>After you finish the sandwich, ask your students if they think clear instructions are important. Why?</p> </li> <li> <p>Let students know that they will now develop an algorithm for building a histogram to represent the sleep dotplots they created in the previous lesson.</p> </li> <li> <p>Explain that a histogram, rather than showing the frequency for each value, shows the frequency (or percent, but we will focus on frequency) of all the values that fall in a certain range, called a bin. For example, we might choose bins that go from 0-5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-20, 20-25. Bin widths will vary by class.</p> </li> <li> <p>Model how to create a histogram using the data from the dotplot \u201chours of sleep last night\u201d. On a blank chart, create the x-axis with bin widths 0-3, 3-6, 6-9, etc. and place marks on the plot at those intervals and ask students: \u201cWhat are the frequencies in each bin?\u201d</p> <p>Notice that multiples of three appear in more than one bin. Let\u2019s take the value of 6 hours as an example. Should those observations be included in the second bin (3-6) or the third bin (6-9)?</p> <ul> <li> <p>If students include the values of 6 hours in the second bin then they are using the     left-hand rule.</p> </li> <li> <p>If students include the values of 6 hours in the third bin then they are using the     right-hand rule.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Once the frequencies have been determined, draw the bars with corresponding heights. Do not include spaces between the bars as time is a continuous variable.</p> </li> <li> <p>Next, student teams will create an algorithm that gives directions for how to construct a histogram for the data from the dotplot for \u201chours of sleep they hope to get on Saturday.\u201d Remember, an algorithm is a set of rules that can always be applied. Similar to the way they wrote a process for making a PB&amp;J sandwich, students will write a process for creating a histogram. Tell students to continue thinking of the process to transform the data in the dotplot to create a histogram. The algorithm will produce an output, which will be a histogram. What's the input? Answer: Data, or maybe the dotplot.</p> </li> <li> <p>Inform the students that you will provide a piece of input: how wide the bin will be. For instance, it might be 5 hours, it might be 1 hour, or it might be 10 hours (or half an hour!). Whatever it is, their algorithm should work for any input value.</p> </li> <li> <p>Let students work for a bit. They should write out Step 1, Step 2, etc. Then choose a group and ask them to get you started. Give them a bin width of 4.</p> </li> <li> <p>Teachers should sketch the histogram on the board or chart paper as students read their algorithms. Again, teachers should take things very literally. For example, if they do not tell you exactly where the bins should start, start one way off to the left. If they are vague and say \"divide the number line into groups of 10,\u201d then make them arbitrary sizes. If they have to be the same size, ask them how to do that. Points to consider:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Where do we start drawing the bins? Always at the location of the smallest dotplot? Always at the greatest? A little to the left?</p> </li> <li> <p>What do we do with points that fall exactly on a boundary? Do they go to the bin on the left or on the right? Does it matter? Answer: No, it doesn't matter as long as they're consistent (all in the left or all in the right).</p> </li> <li> <p>Can we do it differently every time? Answer: No. We need to be consistent. This is called either the left-hand rule or the right-hand rule, depending on which is chosen.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>After following 2 or 3 algorithms, ask students if they feel their algorithm is precise enough. Allow students time to revise their algorithms.</p> </li> <li> <p>Have a class discussion about the similarities and differences between the original dotplot and a histogram. Ask:</p> <ol> <li> <p>What have we gained from the histogram? Answer: We now can see the shape of the distribution as a whole.</p> </li> <li> <p>What have we lost? Answer: We lost each individual observation by grouping them into bins.</p> </li> </ol> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"unit1/lesson10/#class-scribes","title":"Class Scribes:","text":"<p>One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.</p>"},{"location":"unit1/lesson10/#homework","title":"<p>Homework</p>","text":"<p>Students should continue to collect nutritional facts data using the Food Habits Participatory Sensing campaign on their smart devices or via web browser.</p>"},{"location":"unit1/lesson11/","title":"Lesson 11: What Shape Are You In?","text":""},{"location":"unit1/lesson11/#lesson-11-what-shape-are-you-in","title":"Lesson 11: What Shape Are You In?","text":""},{"location":"unit1/lesson11/#objective","title":"Objective:","text":"<p>Students will learn to classify distributions in terms of shape, and can suggest theories for why a distribution might be one shape or another.</p>"},{"location":"unit1/lesson11/#materials","title":"Materials:","text":"<ol> <li>Sorting Histograms handout (LMR_U1_L11) - one copy per group of 4 students.

The specific answers are not important; but what is important is to know how to obtain the information. Possible answer: You would find the proportion of students who do not play an instrument by dividing the number in the \"Total\" row that is in the \"Does not play instrument\" column by the total number of students (35).</p> </li> <li> <p>After a few minutes, ask a team to volunteer a response. Mark up the margins on the table to show that the cells with the initial total counts are called marginal frequencies, like in 13a.

The specific answers are not important; but what is important is to know how to obtain the information. Possible answer: You would first find the \"Total\" number of students who play an instrument (17). Then, to find the proportion of those students who own a cat, you would look at how many students own a cat within that column (7) and divide it by the \"Total\" who \"Plays an instrument\" (7/17).</p> </li> <li> <p>After a few minutes, ask a team to volunteer a response.

This is a conditional relative frequency by column.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Finally, suppose that we wanted to answer the question: Do a greater proportion of students in Rosa's art class who do not play an instrument own a cat than those who do play an instrument?</p> </li> <li> <p>In teams, discuss where on the table you would find this information and how you would calculate it. The specific answers are not important; but what is important is to know how to obtain the information. Possible answer: You would need to find an additional proportion. You would first find the \"Total\" number of students who do not play an instrument (18). Then, to find the proportion of those students who own a cat, you would look at how many students own a cat within that column (9) and divide it by the \"Total\" who \"Does not play an instrument\" (9/18).</p> </li> <li> <p>After a few minutes, ask a team to volunteer a response. Encourage students to agree or disagree with the explanations provided. Lead students to see that the total for the \"Does not play instrument\" column is important because we are now also concerned with that subset of the group. Mark up the \"Does not play instrument\" column on the table to show that we have conditioned, or are bound, by this variable. Compare the values that show the conditional relative frequency for each column, \"Does not play instrument\" and \"Plays an instrument\". A higher proportion of students who do not play an instrument own a cat than students who do play an instrument.</p> <p></p> <p>Note: These are conditional relative frequency by column. We can also calculate conditional relative frequencies by row if we were interested in knowing the difference in playing an instrument for those who own cats versus those who do not.</p> </li> <li> <p>Was Rosa right? Answer: Looking back at our scenario introduced in the last lesson, \"Rosa has a theory that musicians are more likely to own a cat,\" our analysis in steps 19-21 above does not provide evidence to support her theory. We found that a higher proportion of students who do not play an instrument own a cat than students who do play an instrument.</p> </li> <li> <p>Distribute one full set of cards from the Analyzing Categorical Variables file (LMR_U1_L17_A) to each student team.</p> <p>Advance preparation required: Print the Analyzing Categorical Variables file (LMR_U1_L17_A). The handouts can then be cut into a total of 20 cards (12 visuals, 8 numerical summaries). You will need enough sets of the cards for each student team to share one full set. For example, if there are 5 student teams in a class, then 5 copies of the file will need to be printed so that each team gets all 20 cards.</p> <p>LMR_U1_L17_A</p> </li> <li> <p>Distribute the Interpreting Categorical Variables LMR_U1_L17_B to each student team.</p> <p>LMR_U1_L17_B</p> </li> <li> <p>Each student team will work together and decide which visualization(s) and numerical summaries can be used to answer each statistical question. They will then answer each statistical question, citing a numerical summary as evidence.</p> <p>Note: Student teams may tape or glue visuals and numerical summaries onto LMR_U1_L17_B, or they can simply write the plot letter and table number in the appropriate box. The blank column is for student teams to write a statistical question than can be answered with a visual and a numerical summary that was not used.</p> </li> <li> <p>After student teams have been allotted ample time to complete LMR_U1_L17_B, lead a class discussion to go over the answers. It is extremely important to have students justify their answers by referring to their visuals and tables.

In other words, does a value appear more than once in a column? Give two examples. Answers will vary. One example could be that Dakota, Kamryn, Emerson, and London all wear sneakers. Another example could be that Charlie and Jessie are both 61 inches tall.</p> </li> <li> <p>Do any of the people in the data have different values for a given variable? Answer: Absolutely. There are many instances of this in the data table.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Discuss the term variability. As in question (b) above, the values for each variable vary depending on which person we are observing. This shows that the data has variability, and the first step in any investigation is to notice variability. We can see the relationship between the terms variable and variability.

The term statistical questions encompasses the variety of questions asked during the statistical problem-solving process which support statistical thinking and reasoning. Statistical questions are perhaps the most important because they are challenging to learn and are the types of questions that determine whether an analysis is productive or not.  Statistical questions are questions that address variability and are productive in that they motivate data collection, analysis, and interpretation. The Data Collection phase might consist of collecting data through Participatory Sensing or some other means, or it might consist of examining previously collected data to determine the quality of the data for answering the statistical questions. Data Analysis is almost always done on the computer and consists of creating relevant graphics and numerical summaries of the data. Data Interpretation is involved with using the analysis to answer the statistical questions. </p> <p>If you haven't done so already, create your IDS class and import users.</p> <p>a) Watch this video to learn how to set up and manage a class.

For each artifact, they will move to the corner of the room they feel that artifact represents (posing a statistical question, consider data, analyze data, interpret data). If you have limited space in your classroom or for students that cannot physically participate, you might consider printing LMR_U1_L4_B. Students can participate by pointing to the spinner.     LMR_U1_L4_B</p> </li> <li> <p>Once students have chosen a corner of the room (stage of the Data Cycle) they will discuss the following with their classmates in that same corner:</p> <ol> <li> <p>What part of the data cycle does the artifact represent (posing a statistical question, consider data, analyze data, interpret data)?

The variable of interest is the number of friends. The group or population we are interested in is clear No. Teacher should ask: \u201cWho did the researchers want to learn about?\u201d These stick figures. The question can be answered with the data Yes. The researchers collected data on the number of friends. The question asks about the whole group, not an individual No. This question is about an individual stick figure. Teacher should ask: \u201cHow can we reword the question to include the whole group?\u201d How many friends do ... have? The intention is clear (e.g., summary, comparison, association) It is clear that this is a summary statistical question (single variable), specifically the number of friends. The question is one that is worth investigating, is interesting, and has a purpose For students, this might be something interesting. <p>Reworded statistical question after going through the criteria: How many friends does this group of stick figures have?</p> </li> <li> <p>As a class, apply the same process to a few of the comparison and association questions. </p> <p>Initial statistical question: I wonder... Does someone who plays a specific sport have more friends?</p> Feature Explanation The variable(s) of interest is/are clear Yes. This seems to be a comparison statistical question comparing the number of friends within the sport played. The group or population we are interested in is clear No. Teacher should ask: \u201cWho did the researchers want to learn about?\u201d These stick figures. The question can be answered with the data Yes. The researchers collected data on the number of friends and the sport the stick figures played. The question asks about the whole group, not an individual No. The word someone gives the impression that we are interested in one observation. The intention is clear (e.g., summary, comparison, association) The intent is somewhat clear. This seems to be a comparison statistical question between the sport the stick figures played and the number of friends each stick figure had. Teacher should ask: \u201cWhat is the variable that is being compared? Which groups within the sport variable are you comparing (all groups, specific groups)?\u201d. The question is one that is worth investigating, is interesting, and has a purpose For students, this might be something interesting. <p>Reworded statistical question after going through the criteria: </p> <p>Is there a difference in the typical number of friends the stick figures have based on the sport they play?</p> <p>Do the stick figures who play soccer tend to have more friends than the stick figures who play tennis?</p> </li> <li> <p>Using the criteria of a good statistical question, student teams will go back and modify their statistical questions. Facilitators will ensure the team goes through the criteria for each statistical question. Task Managers will encourage everyone to contribute. Resource Managers will ensure all materials are easily accessible for recording and reporting. Recorders in each team will capture team members\u2019 responses while the teacher circulates the room to check for understanding.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ask the Reporters of selected teams to share their revised statistical question(s).

Data should only be collected for anything eaten in between meals, like fruit, chips, cookies, nuts, sodas, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ask students why it makes sense to study snacks specifically. Brainstorm some questions that could be answered using the snack-only data that would be hard to answer if the data included meals as well.</p> </li> <li> <p>Inform students that they will be taking part in a specific data collection method know as Participatory Sensing via a mobile application. This application can gather data via surveys, images, and GPS tracking. For students who choose to share their location, their precise location will not appear on the shared IDS map.

Students will need to keep this information in a safe place for the entire duration of this course. Emphasize the importance of keeping their username and password confidential. When students receive their login information, they can log in to the app. If students have trouble with their logins, the teacher has the ability to reset a student\u2019s password.</p> </li> <li> <p>Once logged into the app or the browser-based version, students will see the campaigns in which they will participate.

For this course, they will need to understand photo ethics. They may NOT take pictures of any person\u2019s identifying features such as faces, hair, hands, tattoos, etc. For this campaign, they may only take pictures of their snacks and/or the nutrition facts labels.</p> <p>Note to teacher: Inspect students\u2019 data collection photos throughout the data collection period and before each data collection, monitoring to ensure that no inappropriate images are shared.

Make sure they fold each piece of tape to make two sticky sides. Have each student tape one sticky side to the back of each label and ask them to have the labels ready to tape onto the poster paper.</p> </li> <li> <p>As a class, ask students to select 2 numerical variables and 1 categorical variable from the Food Habits Data Collection handout whose data they would like to see in a visualization, which is a picture of the data. For example, students may vote to see a visualization of the following numerical variables: calories per serving, total fat per serving; categorical variable: salty_sweet</p> </li> <li> <p>Once students select the variables, inform them that they will be creating a plot with the nutrition facts labels for each of the variables they selected.</p> </li> <li> <p>Create a bargraph of the categorical variable chosen by the students. Begin by showing students how to clearly label the x-axis with the categories. For instance, if salty_sweet is the variable, ask students to identify the categories for that variable. Then mark the y-axis with the label frequency, which simply means the number of times an outcome occurs. Do not put tick-marks on the y-axis. The frequency will be measured by the number of labels plotted.</p> </li> <li> <p>Have students come up and place their nutrition fact label above the category that describes their snack. Have students stack their nutrition label so that is easy to calculate the frequency. Once all the labels have been placed, create bars with the appropriate height (frequency) for each category. Make sure to leave spaces between the bars, and that bars are the same width.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ask students to respond to the following questions in their DS journals:</p> <ol> <li> <p>How many data points does this distribution have? Why? Answers will vary by class.</p> </li> <li> <p>What information is this visualization telling us about [insert categorical variable name] in the snacks we consume? Answers will vary by class.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Use another piece of poster paper to create a distribution for the first numerical variable chosen by the students.</p> </li> <li> <p>Create a dotplot of the first numerical variable chosen by the students. Begin by showing students how to clearly label the x-axis. For instance, if calories per serving is the variable, ask students for the range of values for calories per serving and determine the minimum and maximum values for the dataset. Clearly label the x-axis with adequate intervals and the variable\u2019s name. Then mark the y-axis with the label frequency, which simply means the number of times a value occurs. Do not put tick-marks on the y-axis. The frequency will be measured by the number of labels plotted.</p> </li> <li> <p>For each value in the dataset, put a nutrition facts label above that value on the x-axis. When a value occurs more than once, stack the nutrition facts labels. For example, if there are three nutrition facts labels with 120 calories per serving in the dataset, there will be three nutrition facts labels above the 120 mark on the x-axis.</p> </li> <li> <p>Once all the labels have been placed, ask students to observe the distribution of the data in the dotplot. Ask students to respond to the following questions in their DS journals:</p> <ol> <li> <p>What are the minimum and the maximum values of the dataset? Answers will vary by class.</p> </li> <li> <p>The range is the largest value minus the smallest value. It is one way of measuring the variability of a variable. What is the range, and why do you think this measures the variability? Answers will vary by class. The range measures variability because if the values of the variable are really different, the range will be a big number (because the max and min will be far apart); but if there is little variability, the range will be small. For example, if all of the values were the same, we would have no variability and the range would be 0 because the max and min would be the same number.</p> </li> <li> <p>How many data points does this distribution have? Why? Answers will vary by class.</p> </li> <li> <p>What is the amount of [insert variable name] that appears most often in a snack? Why? Answers will vary by class.</p> </li> <li> <p>What do you think the phrase distribution of the data set means? Answer: It shows us how values are distributed. We learn where there are many values, where there are only a few values, and where there are no values at all.</p> </li> <li> <p>What information is this distribution telling us about the [insert variable name] in the snacks we consume? Answers will vary. We see how the value of [variable name] varies. For example, we can see whether all foods have the same number of calories, or if they differ.</p> </li> <li> <p>A distribution tells us two things: the values of the variable and the frequency of the values. \"Frequency\" is just another way of saying \"the count.\" Why is this dotplot a picture of the distribution of [variable name]? Answer: Because the location of the labels on the x-axis tells us the values we saw, and the number of labels at that value tells us the frequency for that value.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Review the students\u2019 responses in a class discussion. Ask students to put a check mark next to the answers that were validated, and to revise the answers that need to be corrected.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use another piece of poster paper to create a distribution for the second numerical variable chosen by the students. Repeat steps 14-16 with this variable.</p> </li> <li> <p>On the first visualization for the numerical variable, show students how to convert the nutrition facts labels into something more readable. Draw another horizontal line on the plot above the nutrition facts labels. Explain that we can represent each label with an item such as a dot sticker or a sticky note.</p> </li> <li> <p>Then, start with the minimum x-value on the plot and place the new sticker above the second horizontal axis. Do this for each nutrition facts label in the plot. Once all values have been represented, ask the students how this new plot IS or IS NOT better than the original. Explain that we can call this type of plot a dotplot since we\u2019re using dots to represent each observation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Distribute the Tangible Plot handout (LMR_U1_L8). Each student should pick one of the 2 numerical variables plotted on the poster paper. Then, they should complete part 1 of the Tangible Plot handout before leaving class. They will complete part 2 of the handout for homework.     LMR_U1_L8</p> </li> <li> <p>Ask students to think about the statistical questions they came up with. Can the visualizations they created in class help answer their statistical question? If yes, answer the question; if not, what visualization would be appropriate?</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"unit1/lesson8/#class-scribes","title":"Class Scribes:","text":"<p>One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.</p>"},{"location":"unit1/lesson8/#homework","title":"<p>Homework</p>","text":"<p>Students will complete part 2 of the Tangible Plot handout (LMR_U1_L8) and bring it to the next class for assessment.</p> <p>Students should continue to collect nutritional facts data using the Food Habits Participatory Sensing campaign on their smart devices or via web browser.</p>"},{"location":"unit1/lesson9/","title":"Lesson 9: What is Typical?","text":""},{"location":"unit1/lesson9/#lesson-9-what-is-typical","title":"Lesson 9: What is Typical?","text":""},{"location":"unit1/lesson9/#objective","title":"Objective:","text":"<p>Students will learn about the typical value when looking at a distribution by finding the \u201ccenter\u201d and determining any point clusters.</p>"},{"location":"unit1/lesson9/#materials","title":"Materials:","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Nutrition facts dotplot (from Lesson 8)</p> </li> <li> <p>Poster paper</p> </li> <li> <p>Markers, dot stickers, or sticky notes</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"unit1/lesson9/#vocabulary","title":"Vocabulary:","text":"<p>typical center shape spread</p>"},{"location":"unit1/lesson9/#essential-concepts","title":"Essential Concepts:","text":"<p>Essential Concepts:</p> <p>The \u201ccenter\u201d of a distribution is a deliberately vague term, but it is one way to answer the subjective question \"what is a typical value?\" The center could be the perceived balancing point or the value that approximately cuts the area of the distribution in half.</p> <p>Optional - Advanced Preparation Needed:</p> <p>Watch this video to learn how to collect data in real time!

Does the typical 12th grader differ from the typical 9th grader? How so? They may say that everyone is different, and that there's no typical student. Keep pressing them to identify characteristics that are typical. The idea is to get them to recognize that there is variability, and yet we might still have an opinion about what is typical. For instance, not all students walk to school, but this might still be the typical experience.</p> </li> <li> <p>Give students 3 minutes to write down synonyms to the word \u201ctypical\u201d in their DS journals. After time is up, have the students share their responses and keep a record on the board. Some possible synonyms might be: normal, average, usual, standard, representative, regular, ordinary, natural, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>Once students share their synonyms, ask students to think about which terms apply best to categorical variables and which terms apply best to numerical variables. Ask volunteers to share out their thoughts and give a brief explanation of why they categorized the term as either applying best to categorical variables or numerical variables. Create a T-chart on the board to keep track of their categories. </p> </li> <li> <p>Next, display the dotplot created by the class with their nutrition facts labels during the previous class (from Lesson 8). Ask: what value might we consider to be the typical value of this distribution? Answers will vary by class. Common answers will be to identify the mode (the value with the most labels) or the value in the center. A common wrong answer will be to confuse the frequency with the value. For example, they will say the most typical number of calories was \"3\" because, perhaps, 100 calories occurred 3 times, and that was more often than any other value. Students may also identify \"clumps\u201d of data: \"it's somewhere between 110 and 120.\" That's okay, but probe them as to why they chose that chunk and not another. The point is to get them to see that chunk as being in the middle or center of the distribution.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Hopefully, at least one student will choose a value close to the center of the distribution. If not, point to a value near the extreme and ask them if they think this is typical. Then move closer to the center until they agree on which values are typical.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is ok to be vague in the definition of typical for today\u2019s lesson. The discussion needs to be very teacher-driven. Some possible points of discussion might be:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Clustering/clumps of data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Most of the observations are between   and  .</p> </li> <li> <p>Overall range of the data.</p> </li> </ol> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Ask students to reconsider the typical number of sugar grams. What is the typical amount of sugar (in grams) in our snacks? For example, students may come up with the same answer for different reasons: \u201cThe typical amount of sugar grams is 10.\u201d The reasons may include the data points are half below and half above; it\u2019s the mode; it has plurality. Then, tie it back to the synonyms for \"typical\" they provided earlier. Ask: Which synonym are you using?</p> </li> <li> <p>In pairs, ask students to discuss the question:</p> <ol> <li>Which synonyms are associated with \u201ccenter\u201d? Is this concept of center useful for numerical or categorical variables? Center is useful for numerical variables. The center of the distribution often corresponds to our notion of \u2018typical value.\u2019 For example, the typical height of the students in our class might be centered around 5\u20195\".</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Inform students that the value at the center of the distribution often matches up with our everyday notion of the typical value of a distribution. The middle observation is not always the typical value. Similarly, the middle person would not always be the center value.</p> </li> <li> <p>Defining the center of a distribution depends on many things, such as the placement of points in the distribution (known as the shape) and how dense the distribution is at certain values (known as the spread).</p> </li> <li> <p>Ask the students to write down the number of hours of sleep they got last night. They will be creating a dotplot of this data, so ask them:</p> <ol> <li> <p>What do you think the typical value will be?</p> </li> <li> <p>What do you think the lowest value will be?</p> </li> <li> <p>What do you think the highest value will be?</p> </li> <li> <p>What do you think the shape of the distribution will look like?</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>One-by-one, have them come up to the board (or poster paper) and put a dot above the correct value on the dotplot. After each student has placed a dot on the board, have a discussion about the distribution. Is the typical value similar to what they originally thought? The shape? The variability? Why or why not?</p> </li> <li> <p>Next, have the students write down the number of hours of sleep they hope to get this Saturday. How do they think this plot will differ from the first plot?

Inform them that this is called sampling with replacement. Ask them to consider what \u201cwith replacement\u201d means and discuss with the class. Answer: \u201cWith replacement\u201d means that after you select a marble from the bag, you have to put it back into the bag (replace it) before you select another marble.</p> </li> </ol> <p>They should draw 10 marbles from the bag and record the observed colors.</p> </li> <li> <p>Do a Whip Around to find out how many times each team drew a red marble out of their 10 draws. Have them calculate the corresponding sample proportions. For example, if one team drew 7 red marbles out of their 10 draws, their sample proportion is 7/10 = 0.70 (which is the sample as a sample percentage of 70%).</p> </li> <li> <p>Ask students why the proportions are perhaps different from each other and from the \u201ctrue\u201d probability of drawing a red marble?</p> </li> <li> <p>Have the student teams continue drawing marbles, one at a time and with replacement, until they have 50 events recorded.

They should see that as they draw more marbles, their sample probability gets closer and closer to the true probability. If we were to continue drawing marbles forever, in the long run, our sample proportion should equal our true probability.</p> </li> <li> <p>Have students consider what it might mean to sample without replacement. How would they do that with their bag of marbles? Answer: \u201cWithout replacement\u201d means that after you select a marble from the bag, you never put it back into the bag (do not replace it). Instead, you simply select another marble from the bag immediately. Students should recognize that, by not replacing the marble each time, the probabilities will change.

Once those groups have been created, have the class calculate the number of students in each group that would have survived a horror film using the actual proportions given in step 14 above. </p> <p>For example: For a class of 30 students:</p> <p>\u2022 46% of 30 (0.46x30) \u2248 14 students representing female characters. </p> <p>\u2022 Of those 14 female characters, 23%, or 3 (0.23x14 \u2248 3), are survivors. </p> <p>\u2022 The remaining 16 students (30 \u2013 14 = 16) represent male characters. </p> <p>\u2022 Of those 16 male characters, 13%, or 2 (0.13x16 \u2248 2), are survivors. </p> </li> <li> <p>Each group should then decide which students will be survivors. Using the 3\u201d x 5\u201d cards, students should write either \u201cdies\u201d or \u201csurvives\u201d on their card.</p> <p>For example (continued from above):</p> <p>Three of the female characters are survivors; so 3 female characters from the group should write \u201csurvives\u201d on their cards. The rest of the group should write \u201cdies\u201d on their cards.</p> <p>Two of the male characters are survivors; so 2 male characters from the group should write \u201csurvives\u201d on their cards. The rest of the group should write \u201cdies\" on their cards.</p> </li> <li> <p>Explain to students that IF there really is no difference between genders in horror films, then the characters who survived would only have done so by chance. In other words, males and females would have an equal likelihood of surviving. Have students discuss the following questions:</p> <ol> <li> <p>How many total people in our class are survivors? What is the total proportion of survivors? Answers will vary by class. Using the example above, there would be a total of 5 survivors from the class of 30 students. The proportion of survivors would be 5/30 = 0.17 = 17%</p> </li> <li> <p>How many of the survivors would we expect to be male? How many would we expect to be female? Answers will vary by class. Using the example above, we would expect to see 17% of males and 17% of females survive since that was the overall proportion of survivors. So, we would expect 0.17x16 \u2248 3 male survivors, and 0.17x14 \u2248 2 female survivors.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Collect all of the 3\u201d x 5\u201d cards from the students and explain that you are going to shuffle the cards and redistribute them so that their genders have no influence on whether or not they survive the horror movie.</p> </li> <li> <p>Visibly shuffle the survives/dies cards to create a random shuffle. Once the cards have been well-shuffled, pass them back out to the students face down. After all the cards are given out, each group should identify the number of people that are survivors and calculate the corresponding proportion of the survivors.</p> </li> <li> <p>On the board, create a table to display the proportions of survivors for each gender, and include a column for the difference (female survivors \u2013 male survivors). Fill in the table with the values the students found in step 20 above.  Note: The first row has been filled in with the example data from above BEFORE the shuffles have taken place. Exact numbers were not used so that the proportions would match the actual horror movie dataset.</p> # of Female Survivors # of Male Survivors Proportion of Female Survivors Proportion of Male Survivors Difference in Proportions (Female \u2013 Male) 3.22 2.08 3.22/14 = 0.23 2.08/16 = 0.13 0.23 \u2013 0.13 = 0.10 ? </li> <li> <p>Note that values in the \u201cDifference in Proportions\u201d column can be positive or negative because sometimes more women will survive, and other times more men will survive.</p> </li> <li> <p>Draw a dotplot on the board labeled \u201cDifference in Proportions.\u201d Include a vertical line at 10% to represent the actual difference in gender survival rates in real horror movies (see example below).</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Using the information from steps 20 and 21 above, place a dot at the corresponding value for the shuffled data\u2019s difference in proportions. Ask the students:</p> <ol> <li>How does this difference compare to the actual dataset\u2019s difference of 10%? Answers will vary by class. Most likely, the difference in proportions will be much smaller than 10%. In fact, the difference in proportions will be centered around 0.</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Repeat steps 19\u201324 from above a few more times (depending on how much class time you have available).</p> </li> <li> <p>Ask the students to record their responses to the following questions:</p> <ol> <li> <p>What was the biggest difference we saw from our shuffles? What was the smallest? Answers will vary by class.</p> </li> <li> <p>What do you think this dotplot would look like if we shuffled our survival cards 1000 times? The dotplot would look roughly symmetric and centered around 0, meaning that if there were no relationship between a character\u2019s gender and whether or not they survive, the difference in proportions would typically be 0.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Have a discussion about how the actual difference in gender survival (10%) is rarely seen when we assign \u201csurvives\u201d or \u201cdies\u201d just by chance (aka when shuffling). What does this mean in terms of who will die in actual horror movies? Since we never (or rarely) saw a 10% difference in the proportions of female survivors versus male survivors, it seems that horror movies actually favor female survivors.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ask the students:</p> <ol> <li>If you were going to be cast in a horror movie, would you want to be a male character or a female character? You would want to be a female character because they are more likely to survive by the end of the film.</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Inform the students that they will learn how to shuffle in RStudio in order to determine if an event is real or simply due to chance.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"unit2/lesson13/#class-scribes","title":"Class Scribes:","text":"<p>One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.</p>"},{"location":"unit2/lesson13/#homework-next-day","title":"<p>Homework &amp; Next Day</p>","text":"<p>For the next 5 days, students will collect data for the Stress/Chill campaign either through the IDS ThinkData Ed App or via web browser at https://portal.thinkdataed.org</p> <p>LAB 2E: The Horror Movie Shuffle</p> <p>Complete Lab 2E prior to Lesson 14.</p>"},{"location":"unit2/lesson14/","title":"Lesson 14: The Titanic Shuffle","text":""},{"location":"unit2/lesson14/#lesson-14-the-titanic-shuffle","title":"Lesson 14: The Titanic Shuffle","text":""},{"location":"unit2/lesson14/#objective","title":"Objective:","text":"<p>Students will continue to understand that, just by chance, we will see differences between two groups.

In case some students may not know about the Titanic, ask a volunteer to share what he/she knows.</p> </li> <li> <p>Explain that, at its time, the Titanic was the largest cruise ship ever built and was declared to be unsinkable. However, on its first voyage, it sank and was one of the worst maritime disasters in history. About 40% of passengers survived; however, your chances of survival depended very much on your age, gender, and wealth.</p> </li> <li> <p>Inform the students that we are going to look at whether the amount of money a passenger paid for his/her cabin (the fare price) had anything to do with whether or not he/she survived.</p> </li> <li> <p>Each student will need a strip from the LMR_Titanic_Strips file\u2014see below for instructions.</p> <p>Advance preparation required: The Titanic Strips LMR contains data from 40 actual passengers on the titanic. Each strip represents the data from one passenger: the left hand side shows the fare paid and right hand side contains the survival information of that passenger after the collision. Cut the LMR into strips such that the fare price is attached to the survivor status for each of the 40 observations. LMR_Titanic_Strips</p> </li> <li> <p>40 strips were created for large classes. If your class has less than 40 students, assign the students to two groups such that roughly 40% of them are in the survivor group (15/40 = 37.5% \u2248 40%), and the rest are in the victim group. If your class is small (smaller than 10), then put the students in two equal sized groups. The split does not have to be exactly 40%, as the actual value from our data is 38.8%.</p> </li> <li> <p>Inform the smaller group that they are the survivors and distribute a survivor strip with its corresponding fare to each student. Set aside any leftover strips. Tell them that the price on the strip represents the amount of money paid for their ticket to board the Titanic. Notify them that \u00a320 in 1912 is worth about \u00a32952 today.</p> </li> <li> <p>Divulge to the larger group that they, unfortunately, are the victims and distribute a victim strip with its corresponding fare to each student. Set aside any leftover strips.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ask each group to create a dotplot of their fare prices on a poster. Lead a quick discussion comparing the two dotplots visually. Then, ask each group to calculate the median fare for their group.</p> </li> <li> <p>As a class, find the difference between the median fares for the two groups.</p> <p>median of \u201cSurvivor\u201d fares \u2013 median of \u201cVictim\u201d fares</p> <p>For example:</p> <p>If all 15 survivor cards and all 25 victim cards are used, the difference is medians would be:</p> <p>\u00a326.00 \u2013 \u00a313.00 = \u00a313.00</p> </li> <li> <p>Explain that one of the controversies of the Titanic disaster was that some people felt that the rich people were given better access to the lifeboats than were the poor, so rich people were more likely to survive. Note that the data represented on the fare cards are only a subset of the actual Titanic data, which had over 800 passengers. However, the data were randomly selected from the real data and are considered representative of the 800 passengers.</p> </li> <li> <p>In pairs, ask students to discuss the following:</p> <ol> <li>Based on the data from our dotplots, do you think rich people were more likely to survive? In other words, did passengers who paid more for their tickets have a better chance of survival? Answer: Yes, there is evidence that rich passengers survived more often than poorer passengers. The median difference between the fare prices of the survivors and the victims is \u00a313.00 (see step 13 above). Most survivors had higher fare prices than the victims, so the distribution of survivor fares is shifted to the right and is more right-skewed.</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Share out a couple of responses with the whole class.</p> </li> <li> <p>Have students tear their strip such that they separate the fare from the outcome (survivor or victim). Collect only the outcomes and randomly shuffle them. Students will keep their fare.</p> <p>Distribute the shuffled outcome strips face down to the students. Once everyone has a new outcome strip, ask students to turn their outcome strip over and re-group based on their new survival status.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ask the students:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Why do we shuffle the survivor/victim strips and not the fare strips? Answer: We want to know if the price someone paid for his/her ticket affects whether or not he/she survived. So, when we shuffle, we assume that fare price has nothing to do with survival, so the prices should be irrelevant.</p> </li> <li> <p>What do you think the median fare difference of our shuffled groups will be? Answer: The median fare difference of the shuffled groups should be close to 0, meaning that there should be NO difference in fare price for the survivors and the victims. Everyone would have the same chances of surviving, regardless of their ticket price.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Have each group calculate the median fare price for their new groups. Then, ask:</p> <ol> <li>Do you think this difference, of ___ dollars, is real or due to chance? Answers will vary by class. Since the data were shuffled, any difference should be due to chance.</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>On the board, create a table to display the median fare prices for each group, and include a column for the difference (median \u201cSurvivor\u201d fare \u2013 median \u201cVictim\u201d fare).

Ask the students:</p> <ol> <li>How does this difference compare to the actual difference of \u00a313.00 (from Step 13)? Answers will vary by class. Most likely, the difference in medians will be much smaller than \u00a313.00. In fact, the difference in medians will be centered around 0.</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Remind students that small differences might be due to chance and big differences typically mean that there is a \u201creal\u201d difference between groups. In this case, a big difference might mean that the rich passengers were more likely to survive. And a small difference might mean that survival was just a matter of plain luck.</p> </li> <li> <p>Repeat steps 17\u201323 from above a few more times (depending on how much class time you have available).</p> </li> <li> <p>In pairs, ask students to discuss whether they think the real difference in median fare prices they calculated in step 13 above (\u00a313.00 if all cards were used) is small or large. Answers will vary by class. Guide students to look at the MAD value of the distribution of differences in median fares.</p> </li> <li> <p>Explain that one way that we can decide what is \u201clarge\u201d or \u201csmall\u201d is by creating cut-off values that we think are too far away from the center of the distributions of differences. In general, we can assign a rule that states that any difference in median fare prices that is greater than 2 MAD values above or below the median is considered unusual. This means that any value in the outer edges of the plot would indicate that a passenger\u2019s ticket price impacted his/her chances of survival.</p> </li> <li> <p>Inform students that they will use RStudio to shuffle the actual Titanic data of all 800 passengers during the next class and can decide if the difference in survival rates of rich passengers and poor passengers was real, or just due to chance.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"unit2/lesson14/#class-scribes","title":"Class Scribes:","text":"<p>One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.</p>"},{"location":"unit2/lesson14/#homework-next-day","title":"<p>Homework &amp; Next Day</p>","text":"<p>For the next 3 days, students will collect data for the Stress/Chill campaign either through the IDS Think Data Ed App or via web browser at https://portal.thinkdataed.org</p> <p>LAB 2F: The Titanic Shuffle</p> <p>Complete Lab 2F prior to Lesson 15.</p>"},{"location":"unit2/lesson15/","title":"Lesson 15: Tangible Data Merging","text":""},{"location":"unit2/lesson15/#lesson-15-tangible-data-merging","title":"Lesson 15: Tangible Data Merging","text":""},{"location":"unit2/lesson15/#objective","title":"Objective:","text":"<p>Students will learn how to merge two datasets and ask statistical questions about the merged data.</p>"},{"location":"unit2/lesson15/#materials","title":"Materials:","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Tangible Data Merging file (LMR_U2_L15)</p> <p>Advance preparation required: Needs to be cut into strips (see step 5 of lesson)</p> </li> <li> <p>Copy paper in two colors</p> <p>Advance preparation required: To distinguish between Dataset 1 &amp; 2 (see step 5 of lesson)</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"unit2/lesson15/#vocabulary","title":"Vocabulary:","text":"<p>merge</p>"},{"location":"unit2/lesson15/#essential-concepts","title":"Essential Concepts:","text":"<p>Essential Concepts: </p> <p>We can enhance the context of a statistical problem by merging related datasets together.

We might therefore expect the average height of this group to be close to 5'5\" as well.</p> </li> <li> <p>Why are more people in the center, and less people in the edges, or tails, of the distribution? Answer: The center represents the mean height. Most women will fall somewhere close to the mean and may be a few inches shorter or taller than it. However, less people are likely to be MUCH shorter or MUCH taller than the mean. For example, we would not expect to see many women who are 4\u201910\u201d tall nor would we expect to see many women who are 6\u20190\u201d tall.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Explain that the normal curve is a good description of a distribution when it makes sense that there is a single 'typical' value with random deviations above and below that value. Ask students:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Why does this make sense with heights but not with incomes? Answer: With heights, we expect most people to be near the average, with some deviations above and below the mean (people who are taller or shorter than the mean height). However, with incomes, the distribution will have more deviations that are above the typical value, since there is no upper bound for a maximum income (ex. Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, etc.).</p> </li> <li> <p>Are there more real-life examples, other than height, that students think might follow a normal distribution? Answers will vary by class. Some examples include: (1) scores on standardized math and reading tests (like the SAT and ACT), (2) IQ scores, and (3) body temperatures.</p> </li> <li> <p>Does it matter that the curve drawn on the photograph does not match exactly to the women\u2019s heights? Answer: No. We often refer to the curve as the \u201cnormal model\u201d because the curve is a just a model of the true population distribution. So, even though the red curve is not exactly the same as the women\u2019s heights, it is a close enough approximation of the shape of their heights.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Note to teacher: The main role the normal distribution has historically played has been in modeling errors (most measurements will be close to the actual value while larger errors occur less often) and sample means.</p> </li> <li> <p>Inform the students that, during the next few lessons, they will be learning more about the normal distribution. In particular, they will learn about a new measure of spread used to describe a normal distribution, how to calculate probabilities from this distribution, and how to randomly sample from this distribution.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cheat Card: Distribute an index card to students and ask them to create a cheat card that will help them remember information about the normal curve.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"unit2/lesson16/#class-scribes","title":"Class Scribes:","text":"<p>One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.</p>"},{"location":"unit2/lesson16/#homework","title":"<p>Homework</p>","text":"<p>Students will complete their cheat cards if they were not able to finish in class.</p>"},{"location":"unit2/lesson17/","title":"Lesson 17: A Normal Measure of Spread","text":""},{"location":"unit2/lesson17/#lesson-17-a-normal-measure-of-spread","title":"Lesson 17: A Normal Measure of Spread","text":""},{"location":"unit2/lesson17/#objective","title":"Objective:","text":"<p>Students will learn that standard deviation is another way to measure variability.</p>"},{"location":"unit2/lesson17/#materials","title":"Materials:","text":"<ol> <li> <p>How Far Apart? handout (LMR_U2_L4) \u2013 completed during Lesson 4</p> </li> <li> <p>How Far Apart?

Have students label the middle tick mark with the mean baby weight (round to the nearest tenth of an ounce = 119.6 ounces). Then ask students:</p> <ol> <li> <p>What weight is one standard deviation above the mean? Answer: A baby whose weight is 137.8 ounces is one standard deviation above the mean baby weight.</p> </li> <li> <p>What weight is one standard deviation below the mean? Answer: A baby whose weight is 101.4 ounces is one standard deviation below the mean baby weight.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Have students label their number line with these values.</p> </li> <li> <p>Have students continue filling their number line with the corresponding weights that are two and three standard deviations from the mean. Answer: A baby who weighs 156 ounces is two standard deviations above the mean weight, and a baby who weighs 174.2 ounces is three standard deviations above the mean weight. A baby who weighs 83.2 ounces is two standard deviations below the mean weight, and a baby who weighs 65 ounces is three standard deviations below the mean weight.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ask students: If the distribution of baby weights is approximately normal, what percentage of babies weigh between 101.4 ounces and 137.8 ounces? Answer: If the distribution of baby weights is approximately normal, about 68% of babies should weigh between 101.4 ounces and 137.8 ounces.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use RStudio to confirm if indeed the distribution of baby weights is approximately normal.</p> <p>one_sd_wt &lt;- filter(Gestation, wt &gt; 101.4, wt &lt; 137.8)</p> <p>Answer: In this sample of 1236 observations, there are 861 babies whose weights are one standard deviation from the mean, so 861/1236 = 0.697. This means that around 69.7% of the weights of the babies in this sample fall within one standard deviation from the mean baby weight. This is close to 68%, so it seems that the distribution of baby weights is approximately normally distributed.</p> <p>Note: If you continue this process for this sample, you will find that the distribution of baby weights is normally distributed as defined by the Empirical Rule. In this sample, 1171/1236 = 94.7% of the baby weights fall within two standard deviations of the mean, and 1229/1236 =99.4% of the baby weights fall within three standard deviations of the mean.</p> </li> <li> <p>Now that it has been verified that a normal distribution is an appropriate model for this distribution, have students draw a normal curve above the number line. Suggested method to obtain a decent normal curve:</p> <p>\u2022 Step 1: Draw a dot 4 centimeters above the mean weight</p> <p>\u2022 Step 2: Draw dots 2.4 cm above the weights that are 1 standard deviation from the mean</p> <p>\u2022 Step 3: Draw dots 0.36 cm above the weights that are 2 standard deviations from the mean</p> <p>\u2022 Step 4: Draw dots right above the number line for the weights that are 3 standard deviations from the mean</p> <p>\u2022 Step 5: Connect the dots with a smooth curve</p> </li> <li> <p>Tell students that we are using this normal curve as a model to represent the distribution of all baby weights. This will allow us to make comparisons, draw conclusions, and make predictions about baby weights. Let\u2019s see:</p> <ol> <li> <p>What percentage of babies weigh less than 119.6 ounces? Explain. Answer: About 50% of babies weigh less than 119.6 ounces. Since normal distributions are symmetric, the mean and the median are about the same. Since the median divides a distribution into equal halves, in this case so does the mean.</p> </li> <li> <p>What percentage of babies weigh between 119.6 and 137.8 ounces? Answer: About 34% of babies weigh between 119.6 and 137.8 ounces. According to the Empirical Rule, 68% of the observations fall within one standard deviation of the mean, and since normal distributions are symmetric, the area under the curve from the mean to one standard deviation is half of 68% or 34%.</p> </li> <li> <p>What percentage of babies weigh more than 137.8 ounces? Answer: About 16% of babies weigh more than 137.8 ounces. From part a and b above, we know that 50%+34%=84% of babies weigh less than 137.8 ounces, so 100%-84%=16% weigh more than 137.8 ounces.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Explain that statisticians use something called a z-score to compare values. A z-score tells us how many standard deviations away from the mean an observation is. Another name for z-score is a standardized score.</p> </li> <li> <p>Introduce the formula for calculating a z-score and discuss what each symbol in the formula means.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Explain that z-scores answer the question: \u201cHow typical is x?\u201d. If x is the same as the typical value (the mean), then z = 0. If x is one standard deviation away from the mean, then z = -1 or +1. Remind students from the normal curve that as you move farther from the center (from the mean), there are fewer observations. Therefore, a large z-score is considered an unusual value.</p> </li> <li> <p>Have students calculate the z-score for a baby that weighs 100 ounces:     z = (100 - 119.6) / 18.2 = -1.08 Ask the class:</p> <ol> <li> <p>What does a negative z-score mean? Answer: A negative z-score means the x value is below the mean. This means that the weight is below average.</p> </li> <li> <p>What does a positive z-score mean? Answer: A positive z-score means the x value is above the mean. This means that the weight is above average.</p> </li> <li> <p>What is the most negative z-score you think we will find? What is the most positive z-score? Answer: Typically, values in a normal distribution rarely fall outside two or three standard deviations from the mean. For data derived from chance, we probably won\u2019t see any values that are less than -3 or greater than +3.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Ask students: \u201cWhere does a baby that weighs 100 ounces fall within the distribution of baby weights?\u201d. Have students find 100 ounces on the x-axis of the normal curve and draw a vertical line from the x-axis until it intersects the normal curve. Have them shade the area under the curve to the left of the vertical line.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tell students that the shaded area represents a percentile in the distribution. A percentile is the exact value in which the desired proportion of observations lies below the specific value in a distribution. Use RStudio to calculate the percentile.</p> <p>pnorm(100, mean = 119.6, sd = 18.2) = 0.140</p> </li> <li> <p>Doctors report percentiles to describe a child's development compared to other children their age. For a baby that weighs 100 ounces, a doctor would report the following: \u201cThe baby is at the 14th percentile in weight.\u201d This means that the baby weighs more than 14% of all babies. This is between one and two standard deviations from the mean so there is no cause for concern with this baby's weight.</p> <p>Note: A z-score can also be used to calculate a percentile, but since a z-score is a standardized score, the mean of the distribution would be zero and the standard deviation would be one.</p> <p>pnorm(-1.08, mean = 0, sd = 1) = 0.140</p> </li> <li> <p>Inform the class that they will be using RStudio during the next few days to practice using normal models. </p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"unit2/lesson18/#class-scribes","title":"Class Scribes:","text":"<p>One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.</p>"},{"location":"unit2/lesson18/#next-2-days","title":"<p>Next 2 Days</p>","text":"<p>LAB 2H: Eyeballing Normal</p> <p>LAB 2I: R\u2019s Normal Distribution Alphabet</p> <p>Complete Labs 2H and 2I prior to the End of Unit Project.</p>"},{"location":"unit2/lesson2/","title":"Lesson 2: What Does Mean Mean?","text":""},{"location":"unit2/lesson2/#lesson-2-what-does-mean-mean","title":"Lesson 2: What Does Mean Mean?","text":""},{"location":"unit2/lesson2/#objective","title":"Objective:","text":"<p>Students will learn that values that gather around the center of a distribution show the typical value.

In statistics, there are a few values that can be considered as measures of center \u2013 the mean is one, and another is the median. The median is the middle value in a group of ordered observations.</p> </li> <li> <p>As a simple example, write or display the following group of numbers on the board:</p> <p>8, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4, 9, 5, 5</p> </li> <li> <p>Since there are 9 numbers in the list above, we should use the 5<sup>th</sup> number as the median because it is directly in the middle and there are 4 numbers above it, and 4 numbers below it.</p> </li> <li> <p>However, students should realize that they cannot simply pick the middle number of the list as it is currently written (this would give a median value of 7).

Answer: The mean and median values in the symmetric distributions -  plots (a) and (d) - are fairly similar. For plot (a), the mean and median are exactly equal. For plot (d), the mean is actually larger than the median, but not by much (2.29 &gt; 2).</p> </li> <li> <p>What did you notice about the relationship between the mean and median values for the left-skewed distributions? Answer: The mean value was smaller than the median value in both of the left-skewed distributions - plots (c) and (f). Both plots had the same values for the mean (2.53) and the median (3.00) - clearly, the mean is much smaller than the median (2.53 &lt; 3).</p> </li> <li> <p>What did you notice about the relationship between the mean and median values for the right-skewed distributions? Answer: The mean value was larger than the median value in both of the right-skewed distributions - plots (b) and (e). For plot (b), the mean was only slightly higher than the median (1.18 &gt; 1). For plot (e), the mean was a decent amount higher than the median (0.47 &gt; 0).</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Steer the discussion towards the relationship between the shape of a distribution and its corresponding mean and median values.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Is there a pattern that emerges between the mean and median values for differently shaped distributions? Answer: Yes! It seems that symmetric distributions will produce similar mean and median values, left-skewed distributions will produce smaller means and higher medians, and right-skewed distributions will produce higher means and smaller medians.</p> </li> <li> <p>For each of the plots in the Where is the Middle? handout (LMR_U2_L3_B), which value better matches your idea of \u201ctypical\u201d for that specific distribution? Answer: For plot (a), both the mean and median agree and appear to be the balancing point of the distribution \u2013 both match what we think is typical. For plot (b), the median seems to be more typical, but the values are very close. For plot (c), the median appears to be a more typical value. For plot (d), both the mean and median appear to be capturing our idea of typical. For plot (e), the median is a better match to typical. For plot (f), the median is also a better match.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Steer the discussion so that students recognize that the better measures of center for skewed distributions are typically medians, and the better measures for center for symmetric distributions are typically means.</p> </li> <li> <p>Display the last 2 plots in the Medians \u2013 Dotplots or Histograms file (LMR_U2_L3_A).

Using Think, Pair, Share, ask students what they think this word means and how it could relate to variability.

You have been asked to perform as part of the tightrope act \u2013 a routine that requires tremendous focus and balance to walk across a tightly pulled rope that is suspended high in the air. In order to practice your balancing skills, the circus has provided your team with a line of tape that will represent the tightrope.</p> </li> <li> <p>Have the students consider the piece of tape (aka the rope) to be the \u201ctypical\u201d path they must take to finish the circus act. Since they do not want to fall from the suspended tightrope while performing at the actual circus, they will need to practice walking directly on the middle of the line at all times. If they deviate from the line, they will no longer be walking the \u201ctypical\u201d path, and will likely fall.</p> </li> <li> <p>Each team should select one student to be their starting performer.</p> </li> <li> <p>In teams of 4, one student is the performer, two are measuring the distance of the deviation (one on each side of the tape), and one is the recorder.</p> </li> <li> <p>Place a ruler perpendicular to the \u201crope\u201d and measure the distance, in centimeters, from the path to the center of the back of their heel as the student walks and attempts to balance across the \u201crope\u201d.</p> </li> <li> <p>The performer will walk the tightrope by looking straight up to the sky \u2013 first they look to place a foot on the line, then walk naturally while looking up to the sky, and repeating one step at a time for 4 steps, measuring after each step. Any time the performer missteps, this is considered a variation from the typical value. You can have students take turns so everyone gets a chance to balance, walk, and to measure, depending on time in your class.</p> </li> <li> <p>Now that the students have an idea about what it means to deviate from something they consider \u201ctypical,\u201d they can start looking at distributions to see how data points vary from their typical value.</p> </li> <li> <p>Inform students that they were observing deviations from typical while calculating actual differences between the rope and the performer\u2019s steps. When data are quantified with numbers, we can then calculate how far away each value is from the center.</p> </li> <li> <p>One such calculation that is popular among data scientists is the mean of absolute deviations (MAD).

After all student pairs have come to an agreement on their answers, pose the following questions to the class as a whole:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Which MAD value did you think would be larger based only on the look/shape of the distributions? Why? Answer: Since plot (c) is skewed to the left, it probably has a larger MAD because more points will be further away from the mean than in plot (a).</p> </li> <li> <p>Which MAD value was actually larger when you calculated it? Answer: The MAD value for plot (c) was larger (1.1418 &gt; 0.8253).</p> </li> <li> <p>Did your prediction match the actual calculated values, or were you surprised by the results? Answer: Yes. The distribution with the wider spread (more variability) had the larger MAD value.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>To continue exploring with the class\u2019s Personality Color survey data, student teams should calculate the MAD value for their Blue scores.

Answer: The middle 50% of heights are close to each other.</p> </li> <li> <p>What does it mean when the IQR is large? Answer: The middle 50% of heights are more spread out.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Finally, subset the class into introverts and extroverts.

Answer: Yes, it is possible to get 78 heads in a row since one coin toss does not determine the next coin toss.</p> </li> <li> <p>Do you think it is likely to get 78 heads in a row? Answer: No, although it is possible to get 78 heads in a row.</p> </li> <li> <p>How many times should we get heads when tossing a coin? Answer: 1 out of 2 times, or 50% of the time.</p> </li> <li> <p>On average, how many times out of the 78 tosses should the characters have gotten heads?

Chance is simply the possibility that something will happen, and probability is a measurement for how often something happens in the \u201clong run.\u201d Students may have ideas about how to calculate probabilities based on prior classes or knowledge, but inform them that IDS will be taking a different approach by using simulations (see next step).</p> </li> <li> <p>Since we don\u2019t want to actually flip a coin 78 times like the actors did in the video, we can have RStudio simulate them for us. A simulation is a way of creating random events that are close to real-life situations without actually doing them. It is a kind of model, which is a way of representing real-world situations so that predictions can be made.</p> </li> <li> <p>Explain to students that R has a function that does coin flipping for us, and that it assumes an equal probability of heads and tails. Using a projector to display your computer screen to the whole class, demonstrate how to do one simulation of a coin flip in RStudio. Use the following function:</p> <p>&gt; rflip(1)</p> </li> <li> <p>Explain that the value of 1 in the argument part of the function tells R to flip the coin 1 time. If we want to flip the coin 10 times, we could simply change the function to <code>rflip(10)</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Run the function again using 10 as the number of times to flip the coin. Ask students:</p> <ol> <li> <p>How many heads (\u201cH\u201ds) were there? Answers will vary for each sample.</p> </li> <li> <p>How many Tails (\u201cT\u201ds) were there? Answers will vary for each sample.</p> </li> <li> <p>In the output, what does Flipping 10 coins [Prob(Heads) = 0.5] mean? Answer: This is RStudio telling us that we are tossing the coin 10 times and that the probability of getting heads is 0.5 because it is a fair coin.</p> </li> <li> <p>In the output, what does Number of Heads: 3 [Proportion Heads: 0.3] mean? Answer: This is RStudio telling us that in our sample, we got heads 3 out of the 10 times we flipped the coin. The sample proportion is automatically calculated for us by dividing the number of heads by the total number of tosses (in this case, 3/10=0.3).</p> <p>Note: This is an example of an output. Your sample may have a different value for the number of heads that appeared, and therefore a different value for the proportion of heads.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>To relate back to the video at the beginning of class, repeat the simulation once more, but use 78 as the number of coin flips <code>rflip(78)</code>. Ask students:</p> <ol> <li> <p>How many heads (\u201cH\u201ds) were there? Since we know to expect about 39 heads if the coin is fair, does the value seem reasonable? Answers will vary for each sample. Most likely, you will see values near 39.</p> </li> <li> <p>How many Tails (\u201cT\u201ds) were there? Answers will vary for each sample.</p> </li> <li> <p>What proportion of the coin flips were heads? Answers will vary for each sample.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Using the rflip(78) command, run the simulation 3-5 more times and have students record the values for the number of heads and the proportion of heads.</p> <p>As an example, we ran the function 3 times and saw the following values:</p> <p>Sample 1 \u2013 amount of heads: 45</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0proportion of heads: 0.577</p> <p>Sample 2 \u2013 amount of heads: 33</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0proportion of heads: 0.423</p> <p>Sample 3 \u2013 amount of heads: 42</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0proportion of heads: 0.538</p> </li> <li> <p>Have students answer the questions below. The important thing to note is that the values can and (almost always) WILL change each time you run the simulation to create a new sample.</p> <ol> <li> <p>How do the proportions of heads in the samples compare to each other? Answers will vary.</p> </li> <li> <p>How do the proportions of heads compare to the true probability of heads (1/2 or 50%)? Answers will vary, but students should notice that most of the probabilities are close to 50%.</p> </li> <li> <p>Why is there a 50% chance of getting heads during each coin flip? Answer: Since there are two sides to a coin, both should be equally likely to come up. So there is a 1 out of 2 chance of getting heads and 1 out of 2 chance of getting tails.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Ask students to engage in a discussion with their group about the statement below, then have a few group reporters share out.</p> <ol> <li>If a coin was flipped 78 times, I would claim that the coin is unfair if I got less than # heads or more than # heads.</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Inform students that you are going to perform 500 simulations. Each simulation represents a coin being flipped 78 times. For each simulation, the computer will record the number of heads in the 78 flips. A histogram will be created that represents the number of heads in each of the simulations. The histogram is a model that will display what typically happens when a fair coin is flipped 78 times.</p> </li> <li> <p>Copy and paste the code below in an RScript and run each line of code, one at a time, for the students:</p> <pre><code>set.seed(11) #reproducibility \nflips &lt;- do(1000)*rflip(78)  \nView(flips) # 4 variables\nhistogram(~heads, data = flips)  \nfavstats(~heads, data = flips)\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Engage the students in a discussion about the histogram:</p> <ol> <li> <p>What is this distribution telling us? Answer: When flipping a fair coin 78 times, what typically happened was that it landed on heads between 36 and 42 times (36/78 = 0.46 to 42/78 = 0.54). It was not uncommon for the coin to land on heads 28-35 (0.36-0.45) times or 43-51 (0.55-0.65) times. What was very uncommon, however, was landing on heads less than 28 times (less than 36%) or more than 51 times (more than 65%).</p> </li> <li> <p>Were your group's cut-offs (item #16) similar to what the chance model displayed? Answers will vary. Some groups' intervals might be very wide and others very narrow.</p> </li> <li> <p>Using the chance model (histogram) which displays what typically happens when a fair coin is flipped 78 times, make a call for the scenarios below - fair or unfair?</p> <ol> <li> <p>You flip a coin 78 times and get 37 heads. Answer: Fair. 37 was very common based on the histogram.</p> </li> <li> <p>You flip a coin 78 times and get 46 heads. Answer: Fair. 46 was less common but not too uncommon.</p> </li> <li> <p>You flip a coin 78 times and get 20 heads. Answer: Unfair. In the 500 simulations not once did we see a FAIR coin land on heads 20 times. </p> </li> </ol> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Next pose the following question:</p> <ol> <li>If you get a heads on the first toss of a coin, will you definitely get a heads on the next toss? Will you definitely get a tails on the next toss? Answer: No. One coin toss should not affect another coin toss. Each time you flip the coin, the chances of getting heads versus tails remains the same.</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Introduce the concept of independence. Explain that, when tossing a fair coin, there is no relationship between each toss. The second toss does NOT depend on the first toss; therefore, the coin tosses are independent of each other.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"unit2/lesson8/#class-scribes","title":"Class Scribes:","text":"<p>One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.</p>"},{"location":"unit2/lesson8/#homework","title":"<p>Homework</p>","text":"<p>Students will create a Tweet (they do not have to post it online).

If they have never heard of them, show one to the class and explain how it works. Answer: A die (number cube) is a 6-sided cube. Each face of the cube is labeled with dots to represent a number between 1 and 6. For example, if the face has 3 dots, then it represents the number 3. The cube itself is weighted so that there is an equal probability of rolling each of the 6 numbers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Have a discussion about what the students would expect the probability of rolling the number 1 should be if a die (number cube) were tossed into the air and allowed to fall back to the ground (or table). Answer: Since there are 6 numbers on the die, each number should be equally likely to occur, so the probability of rolling a 1 is 1/6.</p> </li> <li> <p>Display a piece of poster paper on the board with columns labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Explain that each column represents the numbers on the die (number cube). We will be using poster to tally the results of actual dice (number cube) rolls.</p> </li> <li> <p>Select two students to be dice (number cube) rollers and give each student one die. As noted in the Materials section above, you can have the students use either regular hard dice, or softer foam ones (can be found at dollar stores).</p> </li> <li> <p>Tell the class that each student roller will be rolling the dice 6 times (so there will be a total of 12 rolls for our sample). Ask:</p> <ol> <li> <p>If they are rolling the dice 6 times, how often do you think Student 1 will roll a 3? Would you expect it to be the same for Student 2? Answer: Out of 6 rolls, we would expect to see each of the numbers one time, so we will most likely see about one 3 for Student 1.</p> </li> <li> <p>Would you expect the Student 2 to roll a 3 just as often? Why? Answer: Yes, we should expect the same thing from Student 2 because we have independent events. There are actually two ways that independence plays a part here: (1) each student is independent from the other and has no effect on what the other will roll, (2) the 6 die rolls for Student 1 are all independent of each other because each face of the cube has an equal chance of happening on any given roll. So, if Student 1 gets a 3 during his/her first roll, that doesn\u2019t give us any information about what he/she will get on the second roll.</p> </li> <li> <p>Since we will have 12 rolls (and therefore 12 samples), how many tally marks should we expect in each column on the chart? Answer: We would expect to see 2 tally marks in each column (each number will probably be rolled twice).</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Have each student roller toss his/her die one time and share the outcomes with the rest of the class. As they do this, place a tally mark in the corresponding column on the chart. Repeat this process 5 more times so that each student has a total of 6 rolls.</p> </li> <li> <p>As a class, observe the results in the chart and discuss the following:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Do the data from these 12 rolls match what we expected (see responses from step 8)? Is this surprising? Answers will vary by class. Some values may have shown up more than we expected (example: the number 3 was rolled 3 times), and others may not have been rolled at all (example: the number 5 was never an outcome). We only have a small sample of data, so it\u2019s not surprising for our results to vary from the expected outcomes.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the data do not match our expectations, does this mean the dice are unfair in some way? Answer: Even if they don\u2019t match our expectations, this does not mean the dice are unfair \u2013 we simply don\u2019t have enough data yet to know. We would need to roll the dice more.</p> </li> <li> <p>If we wanted to purposely create an unfair die, what are some ways we could achieve that? Answers will vary by class. Some examples include: (1) We could add tape to one face of the die to give that side more weight. This would increase the chances of the number that is directly opposite of it appearing because the die will land on the heavier side more (and therefore the side facing up will be the number opposite). (2) We could chip the edge of one corner of the die. This would throw off the original balance and favor certain sides.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Similar to the previous day\u2019s lesson with coin flipping, we can also simulate dice rolls in RStudio. The function required is called <code>roll_die()</code>. The arguments for this function are a bit different than the <code>rflip()</code> function from yesterday. We cannot simply put <code>roll_die(1)</code> for the computer to roll a die one time. Instead, the function was built with 2 possible dice to choose from \u2013 die A and die B.</p> </li> <li> <p>Inform the students that one of the dice in the function is fair and the other is unfair. A die is unfair if it favors one outcome over another. They will attempt to determine which dice is the unfair one by doing multiple simulations.</p> <p>Note to Teacher: Many simulations require multiple functions, or code, to perform. This is where RScripts are helpful. An RScript can be used to test code, write notes, and let us easily execute multiple lines of code at one time. This would be a good place to introduce students to RScripts.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Using a projector to display your computer screen to the whole class, demonstrate how to open an RScript. Type the following function on your script and click Run. Run simply pastes the function onto the console.</p> <pre><code>roll_die(\u201cA\u201d, times = 1)\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>The output will show one number that represents what value on the die the computer rolled. Go back to your script and modify the function to roll die A 12 times.</p> <pre><code>roll_die(\u201cA\u201d, times = 12)\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Compare the results of these 12 simulated rolls to the results of the 12 actual rolls completed by the two students during Step 9. If there is space available on the tally chart, you can add the computer results to it for an easy comparison.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ask students how we could record data from these simulations if we wanted to roll the die 100 times. Would they want to hand count the number of times each value occurred? Is there a function in RStudio that will count them for us? Answer: It would be difficult to count every individual value in the output on the screen. However, we can use the <code>tally()</code> function to find out how many times each die value appeared.</p> </li> <li> <p>To make using the <code>tally()</code> function easier, we should assign a name to each simulation so we don\u2019t have to type the entire function multiple times. We can also have it calculate the proportions for each value. Add the functions below to your RScript and run them one at a time.</p> <pre><code>sample1 &lt;- roll_die(\u201cA\u201d, times = 100)\ntally(sample1)\ntally(sample1, format = \u201cproportion\u201d)\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Remind the students that if the die is fair, then each side of the die should appear roughly the same amount of times. Therefore, the proportions should be fairly similar to each other and to the true probability of 1/6.</p> </li> <li> <p>Add the function below to your script, but before running it, ask the students what they think a histogram of the simulated data might look like and then run the command on your screen. Note: Be sure to include the argument <code>nint = 6</code> so that the resulting histogram has six bars. Answer: If the die is fair, each of the bars in the histogram should be roughly the same height.</p> <pre><code>histogram(sample1, nint = 6)\n</code></pre> <p>Note to teacher: Show students how to save an RScript. Inform students that they can take notes on their RScript by including a hashtag (also known as a pound sign or #) at the beginning of the note. Data scientists refer to these types of notes as \u201ccode comments\u201d or simply \u201ccomments\u201d. See image below.</p> <p></p> <p>The Script will be stored in the files tab. To run each function individually, place your cursor on the line and click the Run button. To run multiple lines of code at once, highlight them and click Run.</p> </li> <li> <p>Allow the students to access their school computers now to start creating their own simulations in an RScript using die B. Students can pair up, if needed. Have them begin by asking RStudio to roll the die 100 times. They should note their output from both the <code>tally()</code> function and the histogram. They can then compare the results to those from Step 14. Are they similar? Can they determine which die is unfair yet? Answers will vary by class. The results will be similar, but not exact. With the sample sizes of each simulation being fairly small, we cannot see a clear difference between the two dice yet.</p> </li> <li> <p>Let the students explore by changing the number of times RStudio rolls the dice. Remind them that the goal is to determine which of the two dice is unfair. The sample sizes need to be very large in order for them to see a clear difference between the 2 histograms. The pattern becomes more visible when <code>times = 2000</code>.  </p> <p>Note:  The maximum value for <code>times</code> within the <code>roll_die()</code> command is 2000. Simulations can be combined using the concatenate function <code>c()</code>. For example, suppose s1 represents 2000 rolls of die A and s2 is a second sample of 2000 rolls for die A. To combine these two samples the following can be used <code>more_rolls &lt;- c(s1, s2)</code></p> </li> <li> <p>When students have had enough time to make a decision regarding which dice is unfair and how, engage the class in a discussion to verify that everyone agrees. Answer: Die B is unfair; Die A is fair. Die B favors the number 3.</p> </li> <li> <p>Then, steer the conversation towards why the sample size affected the results. Answer: The sample size needed to be large because the difference between the probabilities of the die rolls was very small. In order to detect small differences, we must have larger sample sizes.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"unit2/lesson9/#class-scribes","title":"Class Scribes:","text":"<p>One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.</p>"},{"location":"unit2/lesson9/#homework","title":"<p>Homework</p>","text":"<p>Students will consider a four-sided die and imagine rolling it 20 times.

Anecdotes are stories that someone tells about his/her own experience or the experience of someone he/she knows.

Their claims are easily debunked. Many anecdotes do not equal data.</p> <p>Note to teacher about witness statements: Lots of evidence suggests that witness testimony needs to be examined very closely. \"As perhaps the single most effective method of proving the elements of a crime, eyewitness testimony has been vital to the trial process for centuries. However, the reliability of eyewitness testimony has recently come into question with the work of organizations such as The Innocence Project, which works to exonerate the wrongfully convicted. This thesis examines previous experiments concerning eyewitness testimony as well as court cases in which eyewitnesses provided vital evidence in order to determine the reliability of eyewitness testimony as well as to determine mitigating or exacerbating factors contributing to a lack of reliability.\" Information gathered from digitalcommons.liberty.edu</p> </li> <li> <p>On the other hand, data are a series of observations, measurements, or facts.

(LMR_Trophy_Hunting_Conservation) to analyze whether the claims each makes are based on anecdotes or data.

The margin of error is plus or minus 3.7 percentage points. Social media and online gameplay are the most common digital venues for meeting friends.\u201d</p> <p>Note: The data for this report were collected via interviews of 1,060 teenagers between the ages of 13 and 17.</p> </li> <li> <p>Discuss the results of the Pew poll with the following prompting questions:</p> <ol> <li> <p>The report says that 57% of teens have met new friends online. Since the report was based on a sample of 1,060 teens, how many of the teens reported that they have met friends online? Answer: 0.57(1060) = 604.2. This means that approximately 604 teens in the sample have met friends online.</p> </li> <li> <p>Do you think 57% of students in our class have met friends online? Why or why not? Answers will vary by class. The discussion should include points about how similar and different samples can be. The sample of students in the Pew poll may not represent the students in our class.</p> </li> <li> <p>What percent of students in our class have met friends online while a teenager? Answers will vary by class. Calculate the percentage by dividing the number of students who have met friends online by the total number of students who came to class today.</p> </li> <li> <p>What if [absent person] were in class today? Would that change our percentage? What effect would it have on the percentage if [absent person] answered \u201cyes?\u201d What effect would it have if [absent person] answered \u201cno?\u201d Answers will vary by class. If a student who was absent for today\u2019s lesson had actually come to class, we would have a different sample of students. It would change the percentage because our sample size now includes 1 more person. If the person answered \u201cyes,\u201d the values in the numerator and denominator of the percentage would change. If the person answered \u201cno,\u201d the value in the denominator would change. (Students should calculate these values.)</p> </li> <li> <p>If we were able to interview every single teenager in the United States, would exactly 57% of them say they have met friends online? Answer: Probably not because there are many more teenagers in the US than the 1,060 they interviewed. It would be unlikely for a group of 1,060 teenagers to exactly represent all teenagers in the entire country.</p> </li> <li> <p>Why do you think the Pew Research Center only interviewed 1,060 teenagers, and not all teenagers in the US? Answer: It would be impossible to talk to all teenagers in the US in a short period of time, or even a fairly long period of time.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Introduce students to the terms population and sample. Explain that a population consists of all of the people we want to learn something about. A sample consists of people (or objects) that are selected from the population. In pairs, ask students to discuss and record answers to the following two questions:</p> <ol> <li> <p>What was the population of interest to the researchers for the Pew poll above? Answer: All teenagers in the US right now.</p> </li> <li> <p>Based on your answer in (a), what characteristics should people have in order to be included in a sample for this poll? Answer: People would need to be in the US and be between the ages of 13 and 17. People could be from many states, but we would not want to sample only people from California, or only people from Los Angeles. It would be impossible to survey every single person in the US; this is why we create a random representative sample of the population. <p>Note: Steer the discussion so that students see that a sample has to be \u201clike\u201d or \u201csimilar to\u201d or \u201crepresentative of\u201d the population.</p> <li> <p>Select pairs to share their responses to the questions and let students revise their responses.</p> </li> <li> <p>Distribute the Populations &amp; Samples handout (LMR_U3_L10_A), which contains survey results from other Pew Research Center reports. Give students time to determine the population and sample for each scenario, and then have them verify their results with a partner.</p> <p>Note: Page 2 of the handout is an answer key for teacher reference.</p> <p>LMR_U3_L10_A</p> </li> <li> <p>State that we want to know the percentage of students in our class that have made friends online, but we don\u2019t want to ask every single student. Instead, we would like to ask only 10 students and then make some guesses about our class from those 10. Ask:</p> <ol> <li> <p>What is the population of interest? Answer: The students in our classroom.</p> </li> <li> <p>How can we select 10 students to be part of our sample? Answers will vary by class. There may be a variety of suggestions; here are some examples of what may be given: (1) put every student\u2019s name in a hat and pick out 10; (2) select the 10 students sitting closest to the teacher\u2019s desk; (3) have 10 students volunteer to be in the sample.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Inform students that, in general, we want samples to \u201clook like\u201d the population. One way to get a representative sample like this is to take a random sample - a sample that is chosen randomly. Ask the students:</p> <ol> <li>Would the selection techniques we came up with in Step 6 result in random samples of our class? Answers will vary by class. Using the examples from step 6 above: (1) putting each student\u2019s name in a hat and then picking out 10 would be a random sample as long as each piece of paper is the same size; (2) selecting the 10 students sitting closest to the teacher\u2019s desk would not be a random sample because those students might not represent the whole class; (3) if 10 students volunteer, we would not have a random sample because those students selected themselves to be part of the group and may not represent everyone in the class.</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Next, assign each student in the class a number by having them count off from 1 to N (N being the total number of students in the class). Show students that we can use RStudio to create random samples with the following function:</p> <p>&gt; sample(1:N, size = 10, replace = FALSE)</p> <p>Note: We use <code>replace = FALSE</code> because we only want each student to be selected once.</p> </li> <li> <p>Using the results given in the output of RStudio, ask the students whose numbers were chosen to stand. Inform them that they are \u201cin\u201d the sample. Then, determine what percent of the sample (these 10 students) have made friends online. How does this percentage compare to the overall class percentage we found in step 2(c) above? Answers will vary by class.</p> </li> <li> <p>Create a dotplot on the board titled \u201cPercent of Students Who Have Met Friends Online.\u201d Record the sample percentage from step 9 above on this dotplot.</p> </li> <li> <p>Have the students return to their seats so that we can select a new sample. Before we do this, ask:</p> <ol> <li>What do you predict the percentage to be for the next sample of 10 students? Answers will vary by class. They might say the expected percentage will be close to the class\u2019s overall percentage.</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Using RStudio, create a new sample, calculate the percentage of those 10 students who have met friends online, and record the value in the dotplot.</p> </li> <li> <p>Repeat step 11 from above for a few more rounds (at least 5 samples should be taken). Be sure that the students give a prediction before finding each new sample.</p> </li> <li> <p>Display the following questions. Refer to the dotplot of sample percentages. Ask students to discuss the questions in teams:</p> <ol> <li> <p>What do you notice about the sample percentages? What is the \u201ctypical\u201d value? Answers will vary by class. The typical value should be close to the class\u2019s overall percent calculated in step 2(c) above since it is the population percent.</p> </li> <li> <p>What is the smallest value? What is the biggest value? Answers will vary by class. There might be a lot of variability in the dotplot based on the selected samples. Most sample percentages will be within 30% of the population value, so that really gives a wide variety of possible sample values.</p> </li> <li> <p>If we took a larger sample \u2013 maybe of size 15 or 20 \u2013 would there be more or less variability in the dotplot? Answer: There will be less variability because adding more people gets us closer to the population size. Be sure to point out that if the sample were exactly the same as the population, then there would be no variability in the plot.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Select teams at random to share their responses to the questions above with the whole class. The rest of the teams should be in full agreement with the responses before moving on to the next question.</p> </li> <li> <p>Explain that the population percentage (the percentage of all students in the class who met friends online) we have been using is called a parameter. A parameter is any number that summarizes a population. So, our class has been the population, and the percentage of students that have met friends online is the parameter.</p> </li> <li> <p>Similarly, the term statistics is used for numbers that summarize a sample. Ask students what sample statistics they have seen today? Answer: Each value we included in the dotplot is a statistic.</p> </li> <li> <p>Be sure to point out that there can be multiple values for a sample statistic (i.e. \u201cWe had 5 sample percentages in our dotplot.\u201d), but there is always only one parameter value.</p> </li> <li> <p>Using these new definitions, ask students to consider the original Pew poll data, which found that 57% of teens have met friends online. Ask the students:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Is 57% a parameter or statistic? Answer: This is a statistic because it is based on a sample. Remind them that the population was ALL US teenagers and the sample included 1,060 teens.</p> </li> <li> <p>What is the population parameter then? Answer: We don\u2019t know! We would have to interview every teenager in the US to determine the parameter, and that is not possible.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Conclude the lesson by telling the students: although we cannot determine the actual population parameter for the percent of teens that have made friends online, we can estimate it using random samples.</p> </li>"},{"location":"unit3/lesson10/#class-scribes","title":"Class Scribes:","text":"<p>One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.</p>"},{"location":"unit3/lesson10/#homework","title":"<p>Homework</p>","text":"<p>Students should complete the Parameters &amp; Statistics handout (LMR_U3_L10_B) for homework.</p> <p>Note: Page 2 of the handout is an answer key for teacher reference.

Ask: \"What might be wrong with using long words in a speech?\" Answers will vary. Ann Wylie, a writing trainer and PR specialist, explains the importance of word length and why we should care about it. In her blog post, she says that using long words in a speech should be avoided in order to increase readability/comprehension and make your ideas more clear/compelling.</p> <p>For example, she cites The Gettysburg Address that has 272 words, of which 174 of them have only one syllable. You can read her blog post here: https://www.wyliecomm.com/2021/11/what-is-word-length-and-why-should-you-care/</p> </li> <li> <p>Ann Wylie states that The Gettysburg Address is a \"small wonder\" in that it uses small words to express big ideas. Share facts about the Gettysburg Address:</p> <ol> <li> <p>President Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address in November 1863.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is one of the most famous speeches in the United States.</p> </li> <li> <p>In it, Lincoln invoked the principles of human equality contained in the U.S. Constitution and Declaration of Independence.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Read the Gettysburg Address aloud to the class OR have students read it aloud. The text of the speech can be found in the Gettysburg Address handout (LMR_U3_L11_A).     LMR_U3_L11_A</p> </li> <li> <p>Today we will use the Gettysburg Address to learn about different sampling techniques.</p> </li> <li> <p>Inform students that the Gettysburg Address contains 272 words. We can consider these 272 words to be our population because it includes all words in the entire speech. From the population, we can sample 10 words that we think represent the speech. It is ok for this step to be vague \u2013 students can come up with their own concept for what they think \u201crepresentative\u201d means in this case.</p> </li> <li> <p>Distribute the Sampling the Gettysburg Address handout (LMR_U3_L11_B), which includes the actual speech, as well as 2 sampling activities. For this part of the lesson, we will only be looking at Sampling Activity 1 on page 1 of the handout.</p> <p>Note: This activity was originally created by Allan Rossman and Beth Chance, and has been modified for the IDS curriculum.</p> <p>LMR_U3_L11_B</p> </li> <li> <p>Inform students that they will get 30 seconds to select 10 words that they think are representative of all words in the speech.</p> <p>Note: It is important that students work fast so they are forced to choose based on first impressions and don't have time to reflect. Also, this activity tends to not work well if students are informed of the punch line (that random samples are unbiased) before they begin.</p> </li> <li> <p>At this point, explain to students that we are actually interested in answering a specific question:</p> <p>What is the typical word length in the Gettysburg Address?</p> </li> <li> <p>Next, students should record each circled word, as well as the number of letters each word has (this is the word length) in the table on the handout. Then, they should summarize the data in a dotplot and calculate the mean word length of the sample.</p> </li> <li> <p>On the board, create a class dotplot (may also be done on poster paper) titled \u201cMean Word Length, Self-Selected Sample, Size = 10.\u201d Once all students have completed the first page of the Gettysburg Address handout (LMR_U3_L11_B), ask each student to record the mean word length of his or her sample on the class\u2019s dotplot.</p> </li> <li> <p>When all students have recorded their sample statistics in the dotplot, conduct a class discussion based on the questions listed below.</p> <p>Note: You might need to do a reality check. Students will often make mistakes when adding the word lengths and when dividing. Be suspicious (and double-check) extreme values.</p> <ol> <li> <p>What does each point on the plot represent? Answer: Each point represents one student's estimate of the mean length of all of words in the Gettysburg address.</p> </li> <li> <p>What is the typical value represented in the dotplot? Answers will vary by class. You should indicate the approximate location of the mean of the distribution (the balancing point), on the dotplot. Remind students that when we ask for the 'typical' value we mean the value in the center of the distribution.</p> </li> <li> <p>How much variability is there in the distribution? Answers will vary by class. One reasonable approach is for students to give the range (the difference between the largest and smallest values).</p> </li> <li> <p>What is the shape of the distribution? Answers will vary by class. Often, the shape is right-skewed, but it might not be for you. Note that outliers here will often be arithmetic errors, but not always.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Next, display the histogram from the Gettysburg Address \u2013 Word Length Histogram file (LMR_U3_L11_C), which shows the distribution of word lengths for the entire population of words in the Gettysburg Address.     LMR_U3_L11_C</p> </li> <li> <p>Remind students that the population is the 272 words from the speech, and inform them that the mean word length of the population, or the population parameter, is 4.22. Using Think-Pair-Share, ask:</p> <ol> <li>How does the typical value of our class\u2019s sample means compare to the actual population mean of 4.22? Answer: Almost always, the class\u2019s typical mean will be higher (sometimes much higher) than 4.22. Some students will be close to 4.22. But point out that we are talking about the \"trend\" or typical outcome. The typical outcome is usually too high.</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Explain that our sampling plan was a self-selected sample, which often produces biased results. Sampling bias occurs when the resulting samples tend to produce results that are influenced in one particular direction.</p> </li> <li> <p>Refer back to the dotplot of sample means and point out how it is biased. Ask:</p> <ol> <li>Why was our original sampling procedure biased? Answer: When we look for 'representative' words, and do so quickly, our eyes are drawn by the larger, more unusual words, and we tend to overlook small words such as \u201cin,\u201d \u201ca,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d etc.</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Go back to the Gettysburg Address handout (LMR_U3_L11_B), and direct students to page 2 for Sampling Activity 2. Inform students that they will now do a sampling procedure that results in a better representation of the population of words in the speech.</p> </li> <li> <p>Explain that a random sample tends to produce unbiased sample results.</p> </li> <li> <p>Before students begin the activity, demonstrate how to generate 10 random numbers from a possible 272 using RStudio.</p> <p>&gt; sample((1:272), size = 10, replace = FALSE)</p> </li> <li> <p>Each student should generate his or her own set of 10 random numbers. Once students have created their random numbers, distribute the Gettysburg Address Word Lengths handout (LMR_U3_L11_D).     LMR_U3_L11_D</p> </li> <li> <p>Explain that the table contains the word number, word, and length of each word in the Gettysburg Address. Demonstrate how to find a word that corresponds to one of the random numbers generated by RStudio, and explain that this word is now part of our random sample.</p> </li> <li> <p>Then, each student will complete the handout by creating a dotplot and calculating the mean of their random sample.</p> </li> <li> <p>On the board, near the first dotplot, create another class dotplot (may also be done on poster paper) titled \u201cMean Word Length, Random Sample, Size = 10.\u201d Once all students have completed the second page of the Gettysburg Address handout (LMR_U3_L11_B), ask each student to record the mean word length of his or her random sample on the class\u2019s dotplot.</p> <p>Note: As in step 9 from above, be sure to check arithmetic for outliers!</p> </li> <li> <p>When all students have recorded their sample statistics in the dotplot, conduct a class discussion based on the following questions:</p> <ol> <li> <p>What does each point in the dotplot represent? Answer: Each dot represents one student's estimate of the mean word length. But this time, the estimates are based on a random sample of 10 words.</p> </li> <li> <p>What do you notice about the typical value in this distribution? Answers will vary by class. They should notice that the means of the random samples are fairly close to the population mean of 4.22. (Again, you might have to discard or correct outliers.)</p> </li> <li> <p>What shape does this distribution have? What does that tell us? Answer: Typically, the distribution of sample means for random samples will be symmetric and unimodal.</p> </li> <li> <p>What does this distribution tell us about the benefits of random samples? Answer: We can reduce bias by collecting random samples instead of self-selected samples.</p> </li> <li> <p>Why do we need sampling?

The following questions can be used to steer the discussion:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Remember that we were aiming to be 90% confident for each question. Based on this, how many of the 10 questions should we each have gotten correct? Answer: If we are 90% confident, then we would expect 90% of the 10 intervals to include the true value, which is 9 intervals.</p> </li> <li> <p>Did anyone in the class get exactly 9 correct? Did anyone get all 10 correct? Answers will vary by class. However, it is very unlikely that many students will have gotten 9 or 10 correct responses on this first round.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Create a dotplot on the board (or on poster paper) titled \u201cNumber Correct\u201d and have each student record his or her value. Then, ask:</p> <ol> <li> <p>How many students got 9 correct? In other words, how many students were actually 90% confident of their intervals? Answers will vary by class.</p> </li> <li> <p>What is the typical number of correct responses for our class? Does it seem too high or too low? Explain. Answers will vary by class. Most likely, the typical number of correct responses will be fairly low (maybe even 4 or less).</p> </li> <li> <p>Why is our typical score so much lower than 9? Answer: We tend to be more confident than we should be, so we create narrower intervals.</p> </li> <li> <p>It looks like, even though we thought we were 90% confident, most of us (or all of us) did not succeed 90% of the time. How could we increase our level of confidence? Answer: We could use wider intervals.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Recall from step 3 above that, in statistics, to estimate something means that we can give a range of values that we are confident include the population parameter value.

Then, call out a flag color at random. Repeat several times. Make sure you call out the flag that has no assignment at least once so that students see that no action took place. Reflect on the activity with the following discussion questions:</p> <ol> <li> <p>What data were missed? Why? Answer: Data about what our class likes to do after school. They were missed because there was no Sensor connected to the Green trigger, so the Collector never knew to collect this type of data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Grocery stores keep track of customer data when purchases are made with a loyalty card. What is the trigger in this case? What data are being collected? Answer: The trigger is checking out at a grocery store. There are lots of data that are collected, including: items bought, cost of items, number of items on sale, etc.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>After they engage in the sensor activity, ask students to revisit their definition of a sensor (see Step 3). Have them revise their definition based on the following concepts:</p> <ol> <li> <p>A sensor is a converter that measures a physical quantity and converts it into a signal, which can be read by an observer or by an instrument.</p> </li> <li> <p>A sensor collects data continuously, or whenever a trigger is activated. A trigger is a something that responds to an event so that an action can occur.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sensors collect data according to an algorithm. An algorithm is a process or set of rules that are followed (just like the rules followed during the activity).</p> </li> <li> <p>Sensors may also collect data automatically, without anyone\u2019s knowledge or input. Examples include GPS location, time, and date.</p> </li> </ol> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"unit3/lesson15/#class-scribes","title":"Class Scribes:","text":"<p>One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.</p>"},{"location":"unit3/lesson15/#homework","title":"<p>Homework</p>","text":"<p>Now that students learned what sensors are, ask them what data they would like to see collected on a sensor that they couldn't collect in an experiment or survey.

There is no difference in the type of questions that are asked when collecting data via surveys and when collecting data via PS campaigns.</p> </li> <li> <p>When deciding whether to use a survey or a PS campaign for data collection, we have to look at the research question of interest. Some questions are better answered with survey data, while others with PS campaigns. Research questions that include variation across time or across locations are good candidates for PS. Some questions might be answered by both.</p> <p>For example:</p> <p>Consider the research question: How does my sense of safety and security change as I go about my daily routine? This question would best be answered via a PS campaign because students could collect data in real time about their sense of security. A possible trigger could be \"whenever you change locations\" or \"once at the start of every hour\" or perhaps whenever a random alarm goes off.</p> <p>Consider the research question: What proportion of high school students are superstitious? This question could be done with a survey based on a random sample from the population of all high school students.</p> </li> <li> <p>Distribute the Sensor or Survey? (LMR_U3_L16) handout.

Participatory Sensing emphasizes the involvement of citizens and community groups in the process of sensing and documenting where they live, work, and play. It can range from private personal observations to the combination of data from hundreds, or even thousands, of individuals that reveals patterns across an entire city. Most important, Participatory Sensing begins and ends with people, both as individuals and members of communities. The type of information collected, how it is organized, and how it is ultimately used, may be determined in a traditional manner by a centrally organized body, or in a deliberative manner by the collection of participants themselves. The latter case, in particular, emphasizes the novelty of Participatory Sensing as an approach and underscores the importance of using widely available and familiar technology.

They should discuss possible triggers that will determine when data should be collected. Allow teams to engage in a discussion about when is the best time to trigger the data collection/completion of the survey. For example: every day at 8am; whenever they practice the cello; whenever they see an advertisement; etc. They should record it in their DS Journals.

To answer this, controlled experiments are required. Controlled experiments have several key features: (1) there is a treatment variable and a response variable, and we wish to see if the treatment causes a change that we can measure with the response variable; (2) There is a comparison/control group; (3) Subjects are assigned randomly to treatment or control (randomized assignment); (4) Subjects are not aware of which group they are in (a 'blind'). This may require the use of a placebo for those in the control group; and (5) those who measure the response variable do not know which group the subjects were in (if both 4 and 5 are satisfied, this is a 'double blind' experiment).</p>"},{"location":"unit3/lesson2/#lesson","title":"Lesson:","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Display the following headlines to students:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Stop Global Warming: Become a Pirate</p> </li> <li> <p>Lack of sleep may shrink your brain</p> </li> <li> <p>Early language skills reduce preschool tantrums</p> </li> <li> <p>Dogs walked by men are more aggressive</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Discuss each headline by asking the following questions:</p> <ol> <li> <p>What is the headline implying with its wording? Answer: 1a is implying that you can stop global warming by becoming a pirate, 1b is implying that it\u2019s possible to shrink your brain if you aren\u2019t getting enough sleep, 1c is implying that having early language skills will decrease preschool tantrums, 1d is implying that dogs are more aggressive when they\u2019ve been walked by men.</p> </li> <li> <p>Is it implying causation or association? Answer: Discuss definitions of causation and association. Causation means there is a cause and effect relationship between variables. For example, heat causes water to boil; whereas association or correlation means that high values of one variable tend to be associated with high values of the other (or high values tend to be with low values). However, this is not necessarily cause-and-effect at play. For example, blanket sales in Canada are associated with brush fires in Australia - not because Canadian blankets cause the fires, but because Canadian winters cause blanket sales, and Canadian winters are Australian summers, which cause fires. 1a, 1c and 1d are implying causation and 1b is implying association.</p> </li> <li> <p>How can you tell the difference between causation and correlation? What words stand out in these headlines? Answers will vary but some terms for causation include: cause, increase/ decrease, benefits, impacts, effect/ affect, etc.; and for correlation include: get, have, linked, more/ less, tied, connected, etc. In 1a, \u201cbecome\u201d stands out; in 1b, \u201cmay\u201d stands out; in 1c, \u201creduce\u201d stands out; in 1d, \u201care\u201d stands out.</p> </li> <li> <p>Change each causal version of a headline into a non-causal version and vice versa. Answers will vary but an example for 1a is to instead say Global Warming linked to increase of pirates.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Introduce the MythBusters video clip by answering the following questions, in teams, for their headline \u201cAre Hands-Free Calls Really Safer While Driving?\u201d</p> <ol> <li> <p>What is the headline implying with its wording? Answer: That hands-free calls might not be safer than holding a phone while driving.</p> </li> <li> <p>Is it implying causation or correlation? How do you know? Answer: Causation because \u201creally safer\u201d implies that driving while on a hands-free call causes you to not drive safely.</p> </li> <li> <p>How can we determine if this is true? Answer: Split the class into groups and have each team come up with a way to determine if this is true. Each group should assume that they get to examine 30 people.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Show the MythBusters video clip called Are Hands-Free Calls Really Safer While Driving? The clip can be found at:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-RAKWdKDEk</p> </li> <li> <p>Focus students on the following guiding questions and ask them to take notes as they watch the video clip:</p> <ol> <li> <p>How did the MythBusters design the investigation? Answer: They conducted a driving test. In this case, one group is driving while on a hands-free call (because in the eyes of the law, this is no different than driving without being on a call). The treatment group is driving while on a hands-free call. They determined that \"safe\" meant passing the driving course by following the turn-by-turn navigation correctly and having no accidents. Passing the driving course was considered a \"success\".</p> </li> <li> <p>What steps did they take? Answer: They split the 30 subjects into two groups, 15 in one group and 15 in the treatment group, and had them drive a car in a simulator.</p> </li> <li> <p>How is this different than your team\u2019s headline responses in step 3 from above? Did the Mythbusters investigation match what you thought it would be about? Answers will vary depending on students' assumptions about the investigation prior to watching the video.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>After viewing the clip, inform students that the MythBusters have just conducted an experiment, which is one method of data collection.</p> </li> <li> <p>We begin with a brief introduction into \u201cwhat is an experiment\u201d but the definition will be developed over the next several lessons.</p> </li> <li> <p>Guide students to identify the elements of an experiment by referring back to the video clip:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Research Question \u2014 the question to be answered by the experiment Are Hands-Free Calls Really Safer While Driving?</p> </li> <li> <p>Subjects \u2013 people or objects that are participating in the experiment The 30 adults.</p> </li> <li> <p>Treatment \u2013 the variable that is deliberately manipulated to investigate its influence on the outcome; this is sometimes known as the explanatory, or independent, variable Having drivers on a call without a cellphone in their hand. Using the research question as our guide, the question implies that we are experimenting with the hands-free calling, therefore that is the treatment as we are comparing it to hands-on calling.</p> </li> <li> <p>Treatment group \u2013 the group of subjects that receive the treatment The 15 people who used the hands-free phone.</p> </li> <li> <p>Control group \u2013 the group that does not receive a treatment The remaining 15 people who used the hands-on phone.</p> </li> <li> <p>Random assignment \u2013 subjects are randomly assigned to either the treatment or control group It's unclear if random assignment was used in this video (if it was, we were not told so), but we're going to assume that people were randomly assigned to each group.</p> </li> <li> <p>Outcome \u2013 the variable that the treatment is meant to influence; this is sometimes known as the response, or dependent, variable Success - whether or not a person was a safe driver by passing the test.</p> </li> <li> <p>Statistic \u2014 a number such as a mean or proportion used to summarize our findings for the control and treatment groups  In this case, the MythBusters gave raw data. A statistic would have been that 6.7% (1 out of 15) of the control group passed the test. Similarly, 6.7% of the treatment group passed the test.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Note: In this experiment, and in those found in the IDS curriculum, we use a treatment and a control group. However, a control group is not a necessary element of an experiment. Sometimes it is more appropriate to have two treatment groups with no control group (e.g., medical professionals testing different doses of drugs). The effect that is being studied will dictate whether to feature a control group or not.</p> </li> <li> <p>Display the following questions on the board or projector. Using T-I-P-S, ask students to discuss them.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Why did the MythBusters follow all of these steps to design their experiment? Answer: In order to determine if driving while on a hands-free call was really safer than driving while holding a cellphone on a call.</p> </li> <li> <p>We don't know how MythBusters chose who would be in the treatment group and who would be in the other group. Suppose that less-experienced drivers were assigned to one group and the more-experienced drivers ended up in the treatment group. Would you believe the conclusions? Answer: No, because less-experienced drivers would probably be more prone to mistakes (because they're inexperienced) than more-experienced drivers. Explain that this --another explanation for the cause-and-effect-- is called a confounding variable.</p> </li> <li> <p>Explain that in order to make the two groups as similar as possible, experimenters usually assign subjects randomly. How might we randomly assign about half of the subjects to the treatment and half to the control? Answer: We might flip a coin, and those who get Heads go to Treatment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Why would random assignment improve the MythBusters experiment? Answer: Because then the two groups would be more similar, so we wouldn't have a confounding variable to worry about.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Emphasize that without random assignment, we cannot determine causation because we are not comparing two similar groups.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"unit3/lesson2/#class-scribes","title":"Class Scribes:","text":"<p>One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.</p>"},{"location":"unit3/lesson20/","title":"Lesson 20: Online Data-ing","text":""},{"location":"unit3/lesson20/#lesson-20-online-data-ing","title":"Lesson 20: Online Data-ing","text":""},{"location":"unit3/lesson20/#objective","title":"Objective:","text":"<p>Students will discover that data exists on the Internet in a variety of areas, formats, and for a variety of purposes.</p>"},{"location":"unit3/lesson20/#materials","title":"Materials:","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Video: Explore a Google Data Center with Street View found at: https://www.engadget.com/2012-10-17-google-inside-data-centers.html</p> </li> <li> <p>Wikipedia \u2013 Video Games handout (LMR_U3_L20_A)</p> </li> <li> <p>Wikipedia \u2013 Video Games \u2013 CSV Format handout (LMR_U3_L20_B)</p> </li> <li> <p>Online Data-ing handout (LMR_U3_L20_C)</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"unit3/lesson20/#vocabulary","title":"Vocabulary:","text":"<p>data farm tags HTML</p>"},{"location":"unit3/lesson20/#essential-concepts","title":"Essential Concepts:","text":"<p>Essential Concepts: </p> <p>Stretching the conception of data involves seeing that many web pages present information that can be turned into data.</p>"},{"location":"unit3/lesson20/#lesson","title":"Lesson:","text":"<ol> <li> <p>By a show of hands, ask students if they have ever heard of the term data farm.

Answer: The indentations help us visually see the structure of the data. For example, all the mountains are contained in the &lt;data&gt; section, but are further tagged by each particular mountain within the &lt;mountain&gt; and &lt;/mountain&gt; tags. All information stored between those two tags will be displayed as one row of the HTML table.</p> </li> <li> <p>What are the role of tags (ex. &lt;state&gt;) and end tags (ex. &lt;/state&gt;) in the XML code? Answer: Tags tell us when a certain type of data begins, and end tags tell us when the data should end. In other words, it tells us where to find the specific values of a variable (ex. Alaska would be the value of the \u201cstate\u201d variable since it is between the &lt;state&gt; and &lt;/state&gt; tags).</p> </li> <li> <p>Where are the variable names? Answer: The variable names can be found between each &lt;mountain&gt; and &lt;/mountain&gt; tags. Specifically, the first variable is \u201cpeak\u201d and the last variable is \u201crank.\u201d</p> </li> <li> <p>Where are the observations? Answer: The observations are located within each of the variable tags. For example, the observation \u201cDenali (Mount McKinley)\u201d is found between the &lt;peak&gt; and &lt;/peak&gt; tags.   </p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Assign student pairs one of the above questions to share out with the class.

Inform students that they will now be copying and pasting their HTML code into the left \"HTML Viewer\" (Input HTML) panel as shown below.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>In order to view how the HTML code displays, click \"RUN\" in the center of the web page as shown below.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Examine the differences in how HTML and XML are displayed. Ask:</p> <p>a. What do you notice? Answers will vary but students might notice that HTML is displayed as a table while XML displays the data in a list-like format. XML also has each data value tied to the variable name while HTML has one variable name for the three data values it represents.</p> <p>b. How does the Output XML compare to the Output HTML? Possible answers might be that XML shows the data organized but not in any type of visualization/table while HTML is displayed as a table.</p> </li> <li> <p>One of the benefits of XML is that removing a data point effectively removes it from the data file but does not necessarily change the integrity of the data - the variable names are still tied to the data values. Demonstrate this by removing a data point from the Input XML and then click \"XML Viewer\" again to see the updated Output XML.</p> <p>Note: In the image below, the <code>&lt;state&gt;Alaska&lt;/state&gt;</code> data point has been removed.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Examine the updated Output XML. Ask:</p> <p>a. What changed when we removed a data point? Answer: The first section of mountain data now has 9 data values instead of 10.</p> <p>b. Can we still analyze this data accurately? Answer: Yes, each data value is still tied to the variable name that represents it.</p> <p>c. What do you think will happen when we remove a data point from our HTML code? Answers will vary.</p> </li> <li> <p>Demonstrate removing a data point from the Input HTML and then click \"RUN\" again to see the updated Output HTML.</p> <p>Note In the image below, the <code>&lt;TD align=\"center\"&gt;Alaska&lt;/TD&gt;</code> data point has been removed.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Examine the updated Output HTML. Ask:</p> <p>a. What changed when we removed a data point? Answer: The table has a blank value at \"rank\" and it appears that all the data values in that row have shifted over \u2013 HTML skipped the missing data value and filled in the rest of the table with the data values given.</p> <p>b.

The group that does not receive the treatment will be the control group. After the treatment, they will measure the groups to see which is taller. Now divide the class into two groups by placing the taller students in the treatment group and the shorter students in the control group.</p> <p>Remember that in an experiment we typically have a treatment group and a control group.

Note to Teacher: As a check for understanding, engage the class in a discussion about experiments. Use the following questions as a guide to assess student understanding.</p> <p>1) When is random assignment used? Why is it important? Answer: Random assignment is used when you wish to determine whether a treatment causes changes in an outcome variable. It's important because it creates a \"balance\" of the group so that the only way the groups differ, on average, is that one gets the treatment and one does not. Thus, if there is a change in the outcome variable, only the treatment could have caused it.</p> <p>2) Below are some headlines. Determine which ones are causal. If not causal, re-write so that it is. If causal, state why it's causal.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Straight A's in high school may mean better health later in life. Answer: Not causal, re-writing answers will vary.</p> </li> <li> <p>Murder rates affect IQ test scores: Study. Answer: Causal, explanations will vary.</p> </li> <li> <p>Microbe linked to Alzheimer's Disease. Answer: Not causal, re-writing answers will vary.</p> </li> <li> <p>Luckiest people \"born in summer.\" Answer: Causal, explanations will vary.</p> </li> </ul> <p>3) Why is a control group important? Answer: The control group is important because it allows us to measure the effects of the treatment group with an untreated comparable group. Without the control group, we don't know what would have happened if we had done nothing. For example, think of a new vaccine for the flu. If there is no control group, and we see the treatment group improving, we will never know if they would have improved anyways, witout the vaccine.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"unit3/lesson5/#class-scribes","title":"Class Scribes:","text":"<p>One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.</p>"},{"location":"unit3/lesson5/#next-day","title":"<p>Next Day</p>","text":"<p>LAB 3A: The results are in!</p> <p>Complete Lab 3A prior to Practicum.</p>"},{"location":"unit3/lesson6/","title":"Lesson 6: Observational Studies","text":""},{"location":"unit3/lesson6/#lesson-6-observational-studies","title":"Lesson 6: Observational Studies","text":""},{"location":"unit3/lesson6/#objective","title":"Objective:","text":"<p>Students will learn that an observational study is a data collection method in which subjects are observed and outcomes are recorded.

For example, we could not inject an HIV infection into participants because the long-term effects might lead to death.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cost Limitations: Sometimes, experiments would be very costly and much too expensive to perform. Some possibilities could be with technology.</p> </li> <li> <p>Feasibility, impossible to randomize: In certain cases, you cannot perform an experiment because it is impossible to randomly assign people to particular groups. For example, you cannot assign a gender to a person.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Distribute What Should We Do? handout (LMR_U3_L7). In teams, students will identify whether the research question could best be answered via an experiment or an observational study.</p> </li> <li> <p>Once all student teams have completed the handout, assign one research question to each team to report out. As each response is shared, conduct a whole-class discussion to compare which data collection method was most appropriate for each research question. Ensure everyone understands the reasons each method was chosen before moving on to the next scenario.</p> <p>Note: Page 2 of the handout is an answer key for teacher reference  only.</p> <p>LMR_U3_L7</p> </li> <li> <p>Next, student teams will generate three research questions on their own.

It seemed that students with higher GPAs had more friends than students with lower GPAs. But did this mean that the cause of a person\u2019s GPA is the amount of friends they have? NO!</p> </li> <li> <p>They also identified other variables that could have contributed to the relationship, these outside variables are called confounding factors. Remind students that we defined confounding factors in lesson 3 - confounding factors provide an alternative explanation to the effect of the treatment on the outcome variable. In this case, the variables are related to both the explanatory variable and the response variable in an observational study.</p> </li> <li> <p>Propose the following statement to students: \u201cResearch suggests that a rise in umbrella sales leads to decreased street crime.\u201d</p> </li> <li> <p>Allow the students to work in teams to think about possible confounding factors. They should choose a variable that is related to umbrella sales, and that might lead to decreased street crime. After they\u2019ve come up with a few possibilities, use the following diagram progression to further explain the impact of confounding factors.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Step 1: Draw an arrow showing that \u201ca rise in umbrella sales leads to decreased street crime\u201d since that is what researchers have stated.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Step 2: Include the variable that might be related to people buying more umbrellas (i.e., the confounding factor). For example, when the weather is rainy, people buy more umbrellas.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Step 3: Draw an additional arrow from \u201cWeather\u201d to \u201cStreet Crime Down\u201d because it is well known that when the weather is bad, people are less likely to be outside committing crimes.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Step 4: Remind students that the original claim was that \u201ca rise in umbrella sales leads to decreased street crime.\u201d However, we\u2019ve now shown that maybe buying umbrellas is not the only thing that could be contributing to a decrease in street crime, which makes us question the link between the two variables.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Step 5: Therefore, we have found a confounding factor with the variable \u201cstreet crime\u201d. This means we can erase the original \u201clink\u201d between a rise in umbrella sales and decreased street crime since there are outside variables interfering. We can\u2019t say buying umbrellas causes decreased street crime, but we can say that a rise in umbrella sales is associated with decreased street crime. We can say that the two variables are associated when the values of one variable relate to the values of the other in some way.</p> <p></p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Once the students grasp what confounding factors are and how to identify them, introduce them to the website Spurious Correlations by Tyler Vigen. This site shows many explanatory and response variables that are randomly associated with each other. Spurious Correlations can be found at: http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>For the example given above, we see that as cheddar cheese consumption in the US increases, solar power generated in Haiti increases. Clearly, it does not make sense that if the US keeps consuming cheese, then Haiti will generate more solar power. It simply happened by chance (or a bizarre chain of confounding factors) that the two variables are related to each other.</p> </li> <li> <p>Allow the students to explore the website on their own. They should choose a graph that interests them and answer the following questions in their DS journals:</p> <p>Note: There are multiple pages of graphs, so they are not restricted to simply the homepage.</p> <ol> <li> <p>What are the two variables shown in your graph?</p> </li> <li> <p>Is there a positive association or a negative association between the variables?</p> </li> <li> <p>Write an interpretation of this plot in the context of the data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Write the data points in a \"spreadsheet format\" in a form that RStudio could read. Each row should represent a point on the graph, and each column one of the two variables.</p> <p>Note: You can get the details about the correlation by clicking on the \"View details about correlation #...\" link.</p> </li> <li> <p>By hand, make a scatterplot of the association. Describe whether the association seems strong or weak or moderate to you.</p> </li> <li> <p>Do you think that the explanatory variable causes the response variable? Explain.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you answered 'no' to f, then draw a diagram like in #4 with possible confounding factors.</p> <p>Note: This can be difficult, depending on the graph chosen. Some factors to consider are: weather, economy, fashion trends.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Example answers to step 7 from above are given below:</p> <p></p> <ol> <li> <p>What are the two variables shown in your graph? Answer: Annual US household spending on fresh fruits and the Canadian National Railway Company's stock price (CNI).</p> </li> <li> <p>Is there a positive association or a negative association between the variables? Answer: There is a positive association because the lines have the same increasing shape.</p> </li> <li> <p>Write an interpretation of this plot in the context of the data. Answer: It seems that as more US households purchase fresh fruits, the Canadian National Railway Company's stock price (CNI) goes up.</p> </li> <li> <p>Answers will vary. For this example, clicking \"View details about correlation #5,901\" showed us the table of data used for the plot.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Can you conclude that the one variable causes the other? Answer: No. Although the two variables are associated with one another, we do not have evidence to say that US households buying more fruit causes the CNI price to increase because the data do not come from a controlled experiment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Draw a diagram like the one we did together earlier (in step 4 of lesson) with possible confounding factors. Student diagrams should look similar to the one below:</p> <p></p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Once all students have selected a graph and have answered the above questions, have them share their responses with a partner. They should explain why they thought their particular graph was interesting, how the two variables are related (directly or inversely), and whether or not there is a causal link between the variables.</p> </li> <li> <p>At the end of this lesson, students should understand that causation can only be concluded when an experiment is performed, but associations can be concluded for observational studies.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"unit3/lesson8/#class-scribes","title":"Class Scribes:","text":"<p>One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.</p>"},{"location":"unit3/lesson8/#next-day","title":"<p>Next Day</p>","text":"<p>LAB 3B: Confound it all!</p> <p>Complete Lab 3B prior to Lesson 9.</p>"},{"location":"unit3/lesson9/","title":"Lesson 9: Survey Says\u2026","text":""},{"location":"unit3/lesson9/#lesson-9-survey-says","title":"Lesson 9: Survey Says\u2026","text":""},{"location":"unit3/lesson9/#objective","title":"Objective:","text":"<p>Students will learn that a survey is another data collection method.

Two family members are chosen to play and must reach a combined score of 200 points to win the money. The goal is to guess the most common responses to five questions. For example, if the question \u201cWhat animal is a common pet?\u201d were asked, each family member might answer with \u201cdog\u201d or \u201ccat\u201d since these are popular household pets.

A possible question might be: What is the typical family size in the United States?</p> <p>Note: This requires a definition of \u201cfamily,\u201d which can have a variety of meanings to different people. Different definitions will likely guide the discussion of possible survey questions in the following step.</p> </li> <li> <p>Next, students need to determine 3 survey questions to help answer the statistical question. The goal in creating survey questions is to make sure they (1) are unambiguous, and (2) address the statistical question.

For example: \u201cHow many siblings do you have?\u201d \u2013 each student would give a response and the values could be recorded in a dotplot (if desired). If the question is too vague (do we include half-siblings, step-siblings, etc.?), students can revise the question.</p> </li> <li> <p>Once the class has agreed upon 3 survey questions for the first statistical question, allow students to join their student teams for the remainder of the activity.</p> </li> <li> <p>Each team should come up with a statistical question that might answer the research question, then determine 3 survey questions that match their statistical question.

An increasing trend is called a  positive association and a decreasing trend is called a  negative association.</p> </li> <li> <p>What does it mean to have an increasing trend and a positive association? Answer: In Box Office Gross per Explosion, it means that as the number of explosions increase, the movie box office gross also increase.</p> </li> <li> <p>What does it mean to have a decreasing trend and a negative association? Answer: In Scores Over Time, it means that as the years after 1999 pass, the movie IMBD ratings decrease.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Quickwrite: What if we had a plot with no association? Ask students to sketch what they think a scatterplot that shows no association looks like.

Answer: Some points are near the line, others are further away, and one point is just slightly touching the line(but not exactly on it).</p> </li> <li> <p>Recall from Algebra that every line can be represented by an equation in the form y=mx+b. In this case, the equation of the regression line is y=0.685xx+94.093. What do the x- and y-values represent in this equation? Answer: The x-values represent the number of explosions and the y-values represent the predicted box office gross.</p> </li> <li> <p>According to the equation, what is the slope of this line? What does the slope mean in relation to the number of explosions? Answer: The slope is 0.685. It is the rate of change between the number of explosions and the box office gross. It means that for every explosion increase of 1 the box office gross increases by 0.685 dollars.</p> </li> <li> <p>When the number of explosions (x-value) is zero, what is the box office gross (y-value)? How do you know? What does this mean? Answer: The box office gross is 94.093 million dollars. Students may use the equation to show that they substituted zero for x, so the y-intercept is the box office gross. It means that if Michael Bay were to make a movie with NO explosions, this would be his projected box office gross.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you wanted to know the box office gross for the point that lies the closest to the line, what would the equation be? Write the equation and solve it. Answer: Box Office Gross=0.685(380)+94.093. Profit=354.393 or 354,3930400 million dollars.</p> </li> <li> <p>What was the actual box office gross for the point that lies closest to the line? ***Answer: The actual box office gross was 352,400,000 million dollars. <li> <p>What if Michael Bay made a movie that had 275 explosions? What would his predicted profit be? Show how you arrived at the solution. Answer: By substituting 275 in the value of x in the equation, predicted profit will be $282,468,000 or 282.468 in millions of dollars, or by finding the point on the line or both.</p> </li> <li> <p>If time permits, have students answer the following questions about the Scores Over Time scatterplot in LMR_U4_L11_A.</p> <ol> <li> <p>What do you notice about where the points are and where the line is? Answer: Some points are near the line, others are further away, and three points are very close to the line (with one slightly touching it but not exactly on the line).</p> </li> <li> <p>What do the y- and x-values represent in this equation? Answer: The x-values represent the number of years since 1999 and the y-values represent the IMDB score.</p> </li> <li> <p>According to the equation, what is the slope of this line? What does the slope mean?Answer: The slope is -0.04377. It is the reate of change between the number of years since 1999 and the IMDB score. It means that for every year since 1999 increase of 1 the IMDB score decreases by 0.04377.</p> </li> <li> <p>When the x-value is zero, what is the y-value? How do you know? What does this mean? Answer: The IMDB score, the y-value, is 6.68592. Students may use the equation to show that they substituted zero for x, so the y-intercept is the IMDB score. It means that if M. Night Shyamalan were to make a movie in 1999, this would be his projected IMDB score, regardless of the movie type or other factors. While knowing the y-intercept allows us to make predictions using this model, the intercept does not have any meaningful interpretation for this model (it's not possible to go back in time to have M. Night Shyamalan produce another movie in 1999).</p> </li> <li> <p>What would the predicted value of the score be if M. Night Shyamalan released a movie in 2030? How do you know? Answer: By substituting 31, because 2030 - 1999 = 31, in the value of x in the equation, the predicted IMDB score will be 5.32905, or by finding the point on the line or both.</p> </li> </ol> </li>"},{"location":"unit4/lesson11/#class-scribes","title":"Class Scribes:","text":"<p>One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.</p>"},{"location":"unit4/lesson11/#homework","title":"<p>Homework</p>","text":"<p>Students will finish answering the questions above about the Scores Over Time scatterplot in LMR_U4_L11_A referenced above.</p>"},{"location":"unit4/lesson12/","title":"Lesson 12: How Strong Is It?","text":""},{"location":"unit4/lesson12/#lesson-12-how-strong-is-it","title":"Lesson 12: How Strong Is It?","text":""},{"location":"unit4/lesson12/#objective","title":"Objective:","text":"<p>Students will learn that the correlation coefficient is a value that measures the strength in linear associations only.</p>"},{"location":"unit4/lesson12/#materials","title":"Materials:","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Strength of Association handout (LMR_U4_L12_A)</p> </li> <li> <p>Correlation Coefficient handout (LMR_U4_L12_B)</p> <p>Advance preparation required: This handout is the resource for the plot cutouts.

Why? Answer: It is not a plausible number of sales because the prediction is too high. The prediction says the retailer will sell about 108,122 units, when the actual sales were about 16,000 units.

This means that, for example, when using the TV model to predict number of items sold, our predictions will typically be off by about 3.373579 (in 10,000s) of units or 33,736 units. Then ask students the questions below. Note: Remember that the MSE will always be in square units.

In the real world, data can be modeled in a variety of ways, many of which are non-linear, and because of this, we can\u2019t easily write down a mathematical equation to help us make predictions. However, we can use what we have learned so far to determine whether or not other models can provide a good fit to the data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Let students know that one method of modeling data in a non-linear way is with decision trees, like the one we saw with the heart attack classification. Explain that decision trees are \"grown\" by using algorithms, or rules, to test many, many different decision trees to find the one that makes the best predictions.</p> </li> <li> <p>A decision tree is basically a series of questions that are asked sequentially. Observations start by answering the first question (at the root of the tree), and then proceed along the different branches based on the answers they give to the questions that follow. At the end, based on all of the questions asked, observations are then classified as one of k classifications.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remind students that algorithms are a series of steps that are repeated a large number of times.

If so, ask those students to share their decision trees with the rest of the class.</p> </li> <li> <p>Inform students that, when faced with much more data, creating classification trees becomes much harder to make by hand. It is so difficult, in fact, that data scientists rely on software to grow their trees for them. Students will learn how to create decision trees in RStudio during the next lab.  Note: Included below is a front-load of the calculation/interpretation of MCR in RStudio.</p> </li> <li> <p>In the next lab, you will use RStudio to create tree models that will make good predictions without needing a lot of branches. RStudio can also calculate the misclassification rate. However, you might find the visual a little confusing to interpret, so we will preview and break down one of the firsts outputs you\u2019ll see in the lab.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Project the image above and explain to the students that the lab uses the titanic data, so we are looking at a total of 1000 observations (in this case, people). In Unit 2, we investigated whether those who survived paid a higher fare than those who died. This lab begins with predicting whether a person survived or not based on their sex \u2013 testing the idea that women were given preference on lifeboats. Much like the ratios we saw for our Round 1 and Round 2 classification trees, RStudio gives us ratios for each of the leaf nodes where a classification was made. The denominator tells us how many observations ended up in that node and the numerator tells us the number of misclassifications. Also notice that the questions are not shown in the classification tree, but the characteristics are visible instead. Ask students:</p> <ol> <li> <p>What does the output 125/641 represent? Answer: The 641 tells us that six-hundred-forty-one people were classified as not surviving based solely on the fact that they were male. The 125 represents people who were misclassified (they actually survived), which means that 516 people were classified correctly (they indeed did not survive).</p> </li> <li> <p>How would you calculate the misclassification rate (MCR)? Answer: You would add all of the numerators which represent the misclassifications and divide by the total number of observations which you could obtain by adding all the denominators. (125+96)/(641+359)=221/1000 or 0.221.</p> </li> </ol> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"unit4/lesson17/#class-scribes","title":"Class Scribes:","text":"<p>One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.</p>"},{"location":"unit4/lesson17/#homework-next-day","title":"<p>Homework &amp; Next Day</p>","text":"<p>Students will record their responses to the following discussion questions:</p> <p>a.

How well could you classify them into football players and swimmers now?</p>"},{"location":"unit4/lesson18/#lesson","title":"Lesson:","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Inform the students that they will continue to explore different types of models, and today they will be focusing on clustering. Clustering is the process of grouping a set of objects (or people) together in such a way that people in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups.</p> </li> <li> <p>Have the students recall that, in the previous lessons, they used decision trees/CART to classify people into different groups based on whether or not a person had a specific characteristic (e.g., whether or not a professional athlete\u2019s team is based in the US).</p> </li> <li> <p>But, sometimes we don\u2019t know what these specific characteristics are. We are simply given numerical variables and asked to find similarities. This is where clustering comes in \u2013 similar people will congregate towards each other, and we want to see if we can identify their groupings.</p> </li> <li> <p>We will look at a very basic example first. Suppose the following 6 observations are given:</p> Obs X<sub>1</sub> X<sub>2</sub> 1 160 74 2 165 72 3 165 74 4 175 68 5 180 70 6 185 72 </li> <li> <p>Plot the X<sub>1</sub> and X<sub>2</sub> points on a scatterplot either on the board or on poster paper (X<sub>1</sub> can be on the horizontal axis and X<sub>2</sub> can be on the vertical axis). The graph should look like the one below:</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Ask students if they think there are any clusters, or groups, that stand out to them. It is likely that they will say there are 2 clusters in the graph: the top left corner 3 points, and the bottom right 3 points.</p> </li> <li> <p>Now pose the following scenario that further describes the data:</p> <ol> <li> <p>A doctor provides yearly physicals to the football and swimming teams at a local high school.</p> </li> <li> <p>The doctor has collected data over the past few years on each player\u2019s weight (in pounds) and height (in inches). She informs us that weight was coded as the variable X<sub>1</sub>, and height was coded as the variable X<sub>2</sub>. You can re-label the scatterplot with this new information.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Unfortunately, the doctor never recorded what sport each person played.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Using the information about height and weight, ask the students to decide:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Which group of points most likely represents players from the swimming team? Answer: The points in the upper left corner are probably swimmers because swimmers are usually tall (and have large arm spans) and thin.</p> </li> <li> <p>Which group of points most likely represents players from the football team? Answer: The points in the bottom right corner are probably football players because they tend to be heavier and more muscular.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Now suppose a new player comes into the doctor\u2019s office for a physical. His weight and height are recorded as 166 pounds and 73 inches, respectively, but the doctor forgets to ask what sport he plays. Plot this point on the graph and ask students to determine which sport they think this student plays. Answer: This student is most likely a swimmer because he is tall and thin, and his point is near the swimming cluster.</p> </li> <li> <p>That was an easy one! But what if a player comes in and has the following measurements: weight = 173 pounds, height = 73 inches?</p> </li> <li> <p>Distribute the Find the Clusters handout (LMR_U4_L18) and tell the students that the new point has been added to the \u201cRound 0\u201d graph.     LMR_U4_L18</p> </li> <li> <p>Ask students:</p> <ol> <li>On which team do you think this person plays? Answer: It is much more difficult to tell now because it looks like it is right in between the two clusters.</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>In order to determine group placement, we can use a process called k-means clustering. With this method, we select k clusters that we want to identify. Since we know we only have 2 types of athletes, football players and swimmers, we will be finding k = 2 clusters.</p> </li> <li> <p>To introduce the students to this idea, circle the 3 points in the upper left corner (the ones that are likely the swimmers) and have students find the \u201cmean point\u201d. This means that they should find the mean x-value and the mean y-value of the 3 points. They can then plot this new point and use it as the mean of this particular group, or cluster.</p> </li> <li> <p>The goal of this algorithm is to keep recalculating means as the clusters change. To begin, we will pick 2 points, A and B, to represent the center of each cluster. We will be referring to this as the initialization step. If you would like to use the point found in step 14 above and label it as \"A\", that is completely fine. You can simply pick just one other random point near the other cluster and label it as \"B\".</p> </li> <li> <p>Initialization: For now, we will start with the following two points as our initial cluster centers of each group: A: (170, 70) and B: (175, 74). In the \u201cRound 0\u201d plot on the Find the Clusters handout, each student should plot and label these two points.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Assignment Step: Inform the students that they will be determining the distance between the 7 observations and point A and point B. Then, they will decide if the point is closer to cluster center A or cluster center B and label the point with that letter.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Lines have been drawn from the top left point to the cluster centers in the plot below as a guide. You can draw this on the board as a reference for the students as well.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Since the line to point A is smaller, we would classify that point as being in cluster A (as shown below).</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>The students should draw similar lines for every point on the graph, or they can simply eyeball it, to make a decision as to which cluster each belongs in. Even if they guess incorrectly, the algorithm should be able to find the correct groups after some time. The correct classifications for Round 0 are as follows, using our points from step 16 above:</p> <p></p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Update Step: Once the class has agreed on the Round 0's cluster classifications, they should compute new values for points A and B by using the clustered point means. For point A, they simply need to find the mean x-value for the 4 points and the mean y-value for the 4 points. Repeat this process to find the new point B \u2013 these will be our new cluster centers as we move onto Round 1. Calculating means to derive cluster centers, like points A and B, for grouping data points is part of the k-means algorithm.</p> <ol> <li>The new points for A and B have been calculated below. The students should be calculating these on their own and recording their new cluster centers on the handout.</li> </ol> <p>x-value for A = (160 + 165 + 165 + 175)/4 = 166.25</p> <p>y-value for A = (74 + 72 + 74 + 68)/4 = 72</p> <p>x-value for B = (173 + 180 + 185)/3 = 179.3</p> <p>y-value for B = (73 + 70 + 72)/3 = 71.67</p> <p>new A = (166.25, 72)</p> <p>new B = (179.3, 71.67)</p> </li> <li> <p>Have the students continue working through the handout until the cluster membership remains the same between 2 consecutive rounds. This means that, from one iteration to the next, the points in each cluster do not change.</p> <p>Note: If students used the initial cluster centers from step 16 above, they would finish clustering in Round 2 with points 1, 2, 3 belonging to cluster A and points 4, 5, 6, and 7 belonging to cluster B.</p> </li> <li> <p>Where you choose your initial points matters in determining which points end up in which clusters. Demonstrate this to the class using the K-means Clustering App, located on the Applications page on Portal under Explore (https://portal.thinkdataed.org/#curriculum/applications/).</p> <ol> <li> <p>In the app, \"centroids\" is the academic term for cluster centers. For this example, we will use 3 centroids and choose a \"Clustered Initialization\" with 100 points and 3 Clusters. See image below for how to adjust the settings.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Move two of the centroids so that they are close to/within one cluster. Move the remaining centroid in between the other two clusters. An example is shown below.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Click \"Next:\" until no points change from the previous update. See image below of end of clustering for the example from (b).</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>While we still have three clusters, we can clearly see that our initial points have influenced the end result of those clusters. You can click \u201cRestart and play again\u201d to move the centroids to the center of the clusters and click \u201cNext:\u201d until no points change from the previous update to illustrate this point (see image below of correctly clustered groups).</p> <p></p> </li> </ol> <p>Note: Clicking \"Restart and play again\" allows you to move your cluster centers to new positions while still using the same 100 points. You can repeat the same process as above to create different additional groupings.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"unit4/lesson18/#class-scribes","title":"Class Scribes:","text":"<p>One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.</p>"},{"location":"unit4/lesson18/#homework-next-day","title":"<p>Homework &amp; Next Day</p>","text":"<p>Write a paragraph that describes k-means clustering in your own words.</p> <p>LAB 4H: Finding Clusters</p> <p>Complete Lab 4H prior to Lesson 19.</p>"},{"location":"unit4/lesson19/","title":"Lesson 19: Our Class Network","text":""},{"location":"unit4/lesson19/#lesson-19-our-class-network","title":"Lesson 19: Our Class Network","text":""},{"location":"unit4/lesson19/#objective","title":"Objective:","text":"<p>Students will participate in an activity to map out their own network based on acquaintances between two people.</p>"},{"location":"unit4/lesson19/#materials","title":"Materials:","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Friend Network Graphic (LMR_U4_L19_A)</p> </li> <li> <p>Index cards</p> </li> <li> <p>Network Code file (LMR_U4_L19_B)</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"unit4/lesson19/#vocabulary","title":"Vocabulary:","text":"<p>network</p>"},{"location":"unit4/lesson19/#essential-concepts","title":"Essential Concepts:","text":"<p>Essential Concepts: </p> <p>Networks are made when observations are interconnected.

Caulfield):</p> <ol> <li> <p>Stop - First, ask yourself if you know and/or trust the source of the page. Don't read it or share it until you know what it is. Second, if you have started working through the moves and find yourself in a \u201cclick cycle\u201d, STOP and remind yourself what your goal is - don\u2019t lead yourself astray down a rabbit hole of facts/links.</p> </li> <li> <p>Investigate the Source - Take time to figure out where it is from before reading it. If it\u2019s from an unfamiliar source, do a Google or Wikipedia search. Here\u2019s a video to help with investigating a source:  https://www.youtube.com/watch_popup?v=hB6qjIxKltA</p> </li> <li> <p>Find Trusted Coverage - This is where we determine if a claim is reliable. Do a Google News search for relevant stories and use known fact-checking sites like snopes.com, factcheck.org, or politifact.com. If there are images in your source, you can do a reverse image search via Google to check its validity or if it\u2019s used elsewhere.

Using a Pair-Share strategy, ask students to discuss when a Participatory Sensing campaign should be used rather than a survey.  Answers will vary.

If a question needs to be answered only once, then a survey is a better method. </p> </li> <li> <p>Remind students that in the last unit, they created one campaign for the entire class.

This is a common practice with statisticians and data scientists. The first dataset of 40 students is called the training data where we train a model to make predictions. Then we use the test data (Dataset A and Dataset B) to test those predictions. Using the training data, the teams used different statistics for their predictions:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Team A used the mean.</p> </li> <li> <p>Team B used the median.</p> </li> <li> <p>Team C used the third quartile.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>In the previous lesson, you created your own rules to determine the winner. Today, you will learn rules that statisticians and data scientists use. The first is called the mean squared error rule.  Note to teacher: acknowledge any groups who came up with MSE or MAE on their own in the previous lesson.</p> </li> <li> <p>An \"error\" is the difference between our prediction and the actual outcome and is sometimes called a \"residual\". The mean squared error is also called:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Mean squared deviation</p> </li> <li> <p>Mean squared residual</p> </li> <li> <p>Residual sum of squares</p> </li> </ol> <p>The formula looks like this, where  stands for the predicted value: </p> <p>Using this formula, the teams' scores are determined by finding the average of the squared differences between their predictions and the actual values. The winner is the team with the lowest mean squared error.   </p> </li> <li> <p>Let\u2019s use R to do the heavy lifting for us. Demonstrate how to find the mean squared error by typing the following commands in the console (throughout the process, show what is happening in the Environment and the dataframe):</p> <pre><code>#First, let's create a vector of the heights in our first dataset:\nheightA &lt;- c(70.1, 61, 70.1, 68.1, 63, 66.1, 61, 70.1, 72.8, 70.9)\n\n#Next, convert this vector into a dataframe:\ndatasetA &lt;- data.frame(heightA)\n\n#Now we find the residuals using one of the statistics.\n#For this example, we'll use the first quartile from the training data (65 inches): \ndatasetA &lt;- mutate(datasetA, residual = heightA-65)\n\n#Next, we will square each residual:\ndatasetA &lt;- mutate(datasetA, sq_res=residual^2)\n#Finally, we use the mean function to:\n#sum up the squared residuals and divide by 10 to find our mean squared deviation:\nmean(~sq_res, data=datasetA)\n</code></pre> <p>This process gives us the mean squared error of 22.05.</p> <p>Note to teacher: The value of the mean squared error will always be in square units. In order to convert back to the original units, simply take the square root of the mean squared error.  Interpretation: When using the Q1 height to make predictions about all heights, our predictions will typically be off by  inches.</p> <p>Here is the vector of heights for Dataset B:</p> <pre><code>heightB &lt;- c(70.1, 72, 68.9, 61.8, 70.9, 59.8, 72, 65, 66.1, 68.9)\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Distribute the A Tale of Two Rules handout (LMR_U4_L7_A).     LMR_U4_L7_A</p> </li> <li> <p>Let's see how well our teams' predictions did on the heights of the test data. Students will work in teams to answer: Using the mean squared errors, which statistic is the winner? Discuss which statistic/team made the best predictions.</p> <p>See answers below:</p> <p></p> <p>Note to teacher: Explain that the mean/Team A was the winner of this contest. Data scientists (and mathematicians) can prove that the mean will always work best (except in a few weird cases from time to time). So if you want to predict the future, the mean is the best single guess you can make.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ask: What if another data science class has a best rule that is different from ours?</p> </li> <li> <p>Another agreed upon method that data scientists and statisticians often use is the mean absolute error. It\u2019s unlikely that students will figure this out on their own. The reasons why we do it in statistics can be proven mathematically but it's beyond the scope of this course. The mean absolute error is expressed as (where  stands for the predicted value): </p> </li> <li> <p>Explain that each team will now use the statisticians\u2019 method for declaring a winner. Display the mean absolute error formula and discuss what each symbol means.</p> <p>Here is the script for MAE:</p> <pre><code>#Find the absolute value of the residuals using one of the statistics\n#For this example, we'll use the first quartile from the training data (65 inches): \ndatasetA &lt;- mutate(datasetA, residual=abs(heightA-65))\n\n#Finally, we use the mean function to:\n#sum up the residuals and divide by 10 to find our mean absolute error:\nmean(~residual, data=datasetA)\n</code></pre> <p>This process gives us the mean absolute error of 4.32.</p> </li> <li> <p>Using our previous examples, recalculate your predictions using the MAE.</p> </li> <li> <p>Using the mean absolute error, which statistic/team is the winner?</p> <p>See answers below:</p> <p></p> <p>Note to teacher: Explain that in this instance, the median/Team B is the \u201cwinner.\u201d This means that the way you play the game depends on the rules of the game. If we used the mean squared error (MSE), play with the mean. If we use the mean absolute error (MAE), play with the median.</p> </li> <li> <p>Optional practice: Students can practice finding the mean squared error and mean absolute error using the mean and median with the Prediction Games handout (LMR_U4_L7_B).

Answer: Find 68 on the x-axis. Then find the data point located at 68. Place finger on the data point and track its location on the y-axis. The height is also 68 inches.</p> </li> <li> <p>Using Talk Moves, conduct a class discussion of the questions in step 5 above.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remind students that we\u2019ve learned that the mean is the best way of predicting heights.

How can you come up with a rule for determining the best predicted height if you know the person\u2019s arm span?</p> <p>Note to teacher: Lead students to realize that they can do this by \u201csubsetting\u201d the data for the fixed x value. For example, if arm span is 60\", they should consider only the heights of people whose arm span is 60\" and find the mean.</p> </li> <li> <p>In teams, ask students to approximate the mean height for people whose arm span is 60\", 64\", 68\", and 72\".</p> <p>Note: Because the plot does not clearly show duplicate ordered pairs, an approximation is sufficient at this point. You may have students use RStudio to calculate the mean height for the specific armspans. Refer to the OPTIONAL section at the end of the lesson.</p> </li> <li> <p>Then plot these points on the graph. We will use this later \u2013 the points should be roughly along a straight line.  Note: These arm spans have a range of height values associated with them. Students may take a mean of the heights, but answers may vary.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ask students if they see any patterns or rules they can use from this to help with predictions. Because there were multiple height values associated with each arm span length, you will likely get multiple answers from students.
