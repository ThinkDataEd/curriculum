Data are everywhere, and this curriculum will help prepare students to live in a world of data. The curriculum focuses on practical applications of data analysis to give students concrete and applicable skills. Instead of using small, tailored, curated data sets as in a traditional statistics curriculum, this curriculum engages students with a wider world of data that fall into the \"Big Data\" paradigm and are relevant to students' lives. In contrast to the traditional formula-based approach, in IDS, statistical inference is taught algorithmically, using modern randomization and simulation techniques. Students will learn to find and communicate meaning in data, and to think critically about arguments based on data. This curriculum was developed in partnership with the Los Angeles Unified School District for a culturally, linguistically, and socially diverse group of students. Upon first publication of the IDS curriculum in 2015, the district-wide student ethnicities included .3% American Indian, 3.7% Asian, .4% Pacific Islander, 2.3% Filipino, 73.0% Latino, 10.9% African American, 8.8% White, and .6% other/multiple responses. Over 38% of students were English-language learners \u2013 most of whom spoke Spanish as their primary language \u2013 and 74% of students qualified for free or reduced lunches. Standards The standards used for the IDS curriculum are based on the High School Probability and Statistics Mathematics Common Core State Standards (CCSS-M) , and include the Standards for Mathematical Practice (SMP) . Specific standards are delineated in the scope and sequence section. The Computer Science Teacher\u2019s Association (CSTA) K-12 Computer Science Standards were also consulted and incorporated. Applied Computational Thinking Standards (ACT) delineate the application of Data Science concepts using technology. Hardware An ideal laboratory environment has a 1:1 computer to student ratio. The computers can be either Apple, PC, or Chromebook, depending upon availability. Internet access is required for the use of RStudio on an external server. The IDS instructor must have access to a computer and a projector for daily use. Software Each computer in the classroom should have a modern, updated web browser installed (such as Firefox or Google Chrome). This will allow students to access RStudio from an external server, and to perform searches and make use of a variety of websites and Internet tools. RStudio is available at https://portal.idsucla.org . The IDS team will provide the remainder of the software used in the IDS curriculum, available at https://portal.idsucla.org This software includes the IDS UCLA app , which is deployed for Android and iOS smartphones and tablets, as well as through the web browser on a desktop or laptop computer. The app allows students to collect the Participatory Sensing data that is a motivational foundation for the course. In addition to the app, students will use the IDS software to access and manipulate their Participatory Sensing data, and to author their own campaigns. All computer-based assignments will be completed in class to avoid the assumption that students have access to computers at home. However, if a student misses a lab assignment, they will need to make it up on their own time. All the software required for the curriculum is available via the Internet, so students can complete the assignment on any Internet-enabled computer (e.g., at the school or public library). Prerequisites It is required that students successfully complete a first-year Algebra course prior to taking IDS. With this background, the curriculum provides a rigorous but accessible introduction to data science and statistics. No previous statistics or computer science courses are required to take this course. The Instructional Philosophy of Introduction to Data Science IDS uses a project-based learning approach to instruction. Finkle and Torp (1955) define Project-Based Learning (PBL) as a curriculum development and instructional system that simultaneously develops both problem-solving strategies and disciplinary knowledge bases and skills by placing students in the active role of problem solvers confronted with an ill-structured problem that mirrors real-world problems. PBL, therefore, is a model for teaching and learning that focuses on the main concepts and principles of a discipline, involves students in problem-solving investigations and other meaningful tasks, allows students to construct their own knowledge through inquiry, and culminates in a project. Because IDS is a mathematical science, the BSCS 5-E Instructional Model provides a planned sequence of instruction that places students at the center of their learning experiences. This model encourages students to explore, create their own meaning of concepts, and relate their understanding to other concepts. The units in IDS contain lessons that, together, fit the 5-E Instructional Model: Stage of Inquiry in an Inquiry-Based Science Program Possible Student Behavior Possible Teacher Strategy Engage Asks questions such as, Why did this happen? What do I already know about this? What can I find out about this? How can I solve this problem? Shows interest in the topic. Creates interest. Generates curiosity. Raises questions and problems. Elicits responses that uncover student knowledge about the concept/topic. Explore Thinks creatively within the limits of the activity. Tests predictions and hypotheses. Forms new predictions and hypotheses. Tries alternatives to solve a problem and discusses them with others. Records observations and ideas. Suspends judgment. Tests ideas. Encourages students to work together without direct instruction from the teacher. Observes and listens to students as they interact. Asks probing questions to redirect students' investigations when necessary. Provides time for students to puzzle through problems. Acts as a consultant for students. Explain Explains their thinking, ideas, and possible solutions or answers to other students. Listens critically to other students' explanations. Questions other students' explanations. Listens to and tries to comprehend explanations offered by the teacher. Refers to previous activities. Uses recorded data in explanations. Encourages students to explain concepts and definitions in their own words. Asks for justification (evidence) and clarification from students. Formally provides definitions, explanations, and new vocabulary. Uses students' previous experiences as the basis for explaining concepts. Elaborate Applies scientific concepts, labels, definitions, explanations, and skills in new, but similar situations. Uses previous information to ask questions, propose solutions, make decisions, and design experiments. Draws reasonable conclusions from evidence. Records observations and explanations. Expects students to use vocabulary, definitions, and explanations provided previously in new context. Encourages students to apply the concepts and skills in new situations. Reminds students of alternative explanations. Refers students to alternative explanations. Evaluate Checks for understanding among peers. Answers open-ended questions by using observations, evidence, and previously accepted explanations. Demonstrates an understanding or knowledge of the concept or skill. Evaluates his or her own progress and knowledge. Asks related questions that would encourage future investigations. Refers students to existing data and evidence and asks, What do you know? Why do you think...? Observes students as they apply new concepts and skills. Assesses students' knowledge and/or skills. Looks for evidence that students have changed their thinking. Allows students to assess their learning and group process skills. Asks open-ended questions such as, Why do you think...? What evidence do you have? What do you know about the problem? How would you answer the question? IDS is designed to develop students' computational and statistical thinking skills. Computationally, students will learn to write code to enhance analyses of data, to break large problems into smaller pieces, and to understand and employ algorithms to solve problems. Statistical thinking skills include developing a data \"habit of mind\" in which one learns to seek data to answer questions or support (or undermine) claims; thinking critically about the ability of particular data to support claims; learning to interpret analyses of data; and learning to communicate findings. IDS employs Participatory Sensing to give students control of the data collection process, and to enable them to collect data about things that are important to them. The curriculum is organized around a series of Participatory Sensing \"campaigns\" in which students engage in all stages of the statistical process, which we call the Data Cycle: asking questions, examining and collecting data, analyzing data, interpreting data and, if necessary, beginning again. As students progress, they engage in the Data Cycle in a deeper way. Initially, analysis and interpretation is purely descriptive. Later, randomization-based algorithms and simulations are used to develop notions of inference and to make students more critical of the data collection process. By engaging in the Data Cycle repeatedly in different contexts - some of which include the students' own designs - students will learn to think like data scientists. Student Team Collaboration Many of the activities in the IDS curriculum are based on students collaborating with each other. Activities may call on pairs or teams of students. It is imperative that teams and team roles be established as close to the beginning of the course as possible. Expectations about teamwork should be introduced as soon as teams are formed. The ideal team comprises four students. The Teacher Resources section provides a list of instructional strategies and a description of team roles to use for effective student team collaboration. If student teams are unfamiliar with these instructional strategies, it is important for the instructor to take the time to model each strategy. Classroom Discussions Because this is an inquiry-based curriculum, classroom discussion will be especially important. It is important to set classroom discussion norms from the beginning of the course. All students should be encouraged to contribute to the classroom discussion, and the learning environment should be as non-judgmental and as open as possible. Instead of one right answer, most questions in this class have many right answers. In fact, even yes/no questions could have two right answers, both with valid supporting evidence. Teachers should create an environment to help students hold each other accountable so that all voices are heard, meaning that if there are a few students who tend to share a lot, invite them to encourage their peers so other voices can be heard. If there are students who tend to avoid contributing to the class discussion, encourage them to share so that their voices are heard. Assignments & Homework As much as possible, IDS work will take place in the classroom. Lessons are designed for a 50-60 minute class period. Classes on block schedule will need to complete two lessons; however, it is up to the teacher to decide where to stop in each lesson. There will be open-ended assignments that are sent home. Assignments that require the computer will be completed in class, to avoid the assumption that students have access to computers at home. The exception to this is if a student misses lab time, in which case they will need to find a time to complete the assignment outside of class. As discussed in the software section above, they can use an Internet-enabled computer to do their make-up work. IDS assignments will not be drill-based. Instead, they will follow the inquiry-based instructional model. Again, most questions will not have one right answer. Instead, students will learn to support their claims with evidence and to participate in data-based discussions. Newspaper or other periodical or digital articles are available via links in the lessons. If desired, articles may be downloaded and printed. On average, students will complete a lab assignment in RStudio approximately once per week. It will be at the discretion of the teacher whether or not to collect lab assignments. Calculators should be available every day for students to use. Every day, students will be expected to bring their Data Science (DS) journal, a notebook where they record their notes, work on small assignments, and sketch plots. Teachers may choose to check DS journals and other assignments in the curriculum for credit. End of Unit Projects, oral presentations, and Practicums are designed as application exercises. Scoring guides are provided as an aid for student performance expectations. It will be up to the teacher to score or attach a grade to these assignments. Overview of Instructional Topics The purpose of IDS is to introduce students to dynamic data analysis. The four major components of this curriculum are based on the conceptual categories called upon by the Common Core State Standards High School - Statistics and Probability: I. Interpreting Categorical and Quantitative Data II. Making Inferences and Justifying Conclusions III. Conditional Probability and the Rules of Probability IV. Using Probability to Make Decisions IDS will emphasize the use of statistics and computation as tools for creative work, and as a means of telling stories with data. Seen in this way, its content will also prepare students to \"read\" and think critically about existing data stories. Ultimately, this course will be about how we discern good stories from bad through a practice that involves compiling evidence from one or more sources, and which often requires hands-on examination of one or more data sets. IDS will develop the tools, techniques, and principles for reasoning about the world with data. It will present a process that is iterative and authentically inquiry-based, comparing multiple \"views\" of one or more data sets. Inevitably, these views are the result of some kind of computation, producing numerical summaries or graphical displays. Their interpretation relies on a special kind of computation known as simulation to describe the uncertainty in each view. This kind of reasoning is exploratory and investigatory, sometimes framed as hypothesis evaluation, and sometimes as hypothesis generation. Interpreting Categorical and Quantitative Data A handful of data interpretations are standard. Some, including summaries of shape, center, and spread of one or more variables in a data set - as well as graphical displays like histograms and scatterplots - are standard in the sense that they provide interpretable information in a number of research contexts. They are portable from one set of data to the next, and the rules for their use are simple. And yet, our interpretation of data is rarely \u201cstandard.\u201d Data have no natural look - even a spreadsheet or a table of numbers embeds within it a certain representational strategy. We construct multiple views of data in an attempt to uncover stories about the world. In addition to numerical data, this course will consider time, location, text, and image as data types, and will examine views that uncover patterns or stories. Throughout the course, simulation will be used to calibrate our interpretation of a view, or of a numerical or graphical summary, so that we understand what \u201cstory-less\u201d data (i.e., pure noise, no association) look like. In addition to summaries and simple graphics, students will engage in a modeling practice aligned with the CCSS mathematical practices in order to learn how statistical analyses can explain and describe real-world phenomena. Students will practice fitting and evaluating standard mathematical and statistical models, such as the least-squares regression line. Modeling comes into play when students are asked to design and implement probabilistic simulations in order to test and compare hypothetical chance processes to real-world data. Making Inferences and Justifying Conclusions Data are becoming increasingly plentiful, supported by a host of new \"publication\" techniques or services. Post-Web 2.0, data are interoperable, flowing out of one service and into another, helping us easily build a detailed data version of many phenomena in the world. Reasoning with data, then, starts with the sources and the mechanics of this flow. Which sources do we trust? How do data from different organizations compare? What stories have been told previously with these data, and by whom? This course answers these questions, in part, by using the tools and techniques already mentioned. The ability to read and critique published stories and visualizations are additions to these tools and techniques. Finally, as an act of comparison, students should also be able to formulate questions, identify existing data sets, and evaluate how the new stories stack up against the old. To support this cycle of inquiry, students will examine the basic publication mechanisms for data and develop a set of questions to ask of any data source - computation meets critical thinking. In some cases, data will exhibit special structures that can be used to aid in inference. The simulation techniques for calibrating different views of a data set take on new life when some form of random process was followed to generate the data. Polls, for example, rely on random samples of the population, and clinical trials randomly assign patients to treatment and control groups. A simulation strategy that repeats these random mechanisms can be used to assess uncertainty in the data, assigning a margin of error to poll results, or identifying new drugs that have a \"significant\" effect on some health outcome. In many cases, data will not possess this kind of special origin story. A census, for example, is meant to be a complete enumeration of a population, and we can reason in a very direct way from the data. In other cases, no formal principle was applied, perhaps being a sample \"of convenience.\" The techniques for telling stories from these kinds of data will also rely on a mix of simulation and subsetting. Finally, this course will introduce Participatory Sensing as a technique for collecting data. The idea of a data collection campaign will be introduced as a means of formalizing a question to be addressed with data. Campaigns will be informed by research and data analysis, and will build on, augment, or challenge existing sources. The \"culture\" behind the existing sources and the summaries or views they promote will be part of the classroom discussions. It is worth noting that everything described so far depends on computation, using a piece of statistical software on a computer. Students will be taught simple programming tools for accessing data, creating views or fitting models, and then assessing their importance via simulation. Computation becomes a medium through which students learn about data. The more expressive the language, the more elaborate the stories we can tell. Probability Since simulation is our main tool for reasoning with data, interpreting the output of simulations requires understanding some basic rules of probability. First and foremost, this course will discuss the ways in which a computer can generate random phenomena (e.g., How does a computer toss a coin?). Simple probability calculations will be used to describe what we expect to see from random phenomena, then students will compare their results to simulations. The point is to both rehearse these basic calculations and to make a formal tie between simulation and theory in simple cases. In that vein, this course will motivate the relationship between frequency and probability. Students will essentially be simulating independent trials and creating summaries of those simulations. In turn, they should understand that the frequency with which an event occurs in a series of independent simulations tends to the probability for that event as the number of simulations gets large (the Law of Large Numbers, a topic that is often taught in introductory statistics courses). From here, students will simulate a variety of random processes to aid in formal statistical inference when some random mechanism was applied as part of the data design. In short, probability becomes a ruler of sorts for assessing the importance of any story we might tell. In this approach to probability, a combination of direct mathematical calculation and computer simulations will be used in order to give students a deep sense of the underlying statistical concepts.

All computer-based assignments will be completed in class to avoid the assumption that students have access to computers at home. However, if a student misses a lab assignment, they will need to make it up on their own time. All the software required for the curriculum is available via the Internet, so students can complete the assignment on any Internet-enabled computer (e.g., at the school or public library).","title":"Software"},{"location":"overview/#prerequisites","text":"It is required that students successfully complete a first-year Algebra course prior to taking IDS. With this background, the curriculum provides a rigorous but accessible introduction to data science and statistics. No previous statistics or computer science courses are required to take this course.","title":"Prerequisites"},{"location":"overview/#the-instructional-philosophy-of-introduction-to-data-science","text":"IDS uses a project-based learning approach to instruction. Finkle and Torp (1955) define Project-Based Learning (PBL) as a curriculum development and instructional system that simultaneously develops both problem-solving strategies and disciplinary knowledge bases and skills by placing students in the active role of problem solvers confronted with an ill-structured problem that mirrors real-world problems. PBL, therefore, is a model for teaching and learning that focuses on the main concepts and principles of a discipline, involves students in problem-solving investigations and other meaningful tasks, allows students to construct their own knowledge through inquiry, and culminates in a project. Because IDS is a mathematical science, the BSCS 5-E Instructional Model provides a planned sequence of instruction that places students at the center of their learning experiences. This model encourages students to explore, create their own meaning of concepts, and relate their understanding to other concepts. The units in IDS contain lessons that, together, fit the 5-E Instructional Model: Stage of Inquiry in an Inquiry-Based Science Program Possible Student Behavior Possible Teacher Strategy Engage Asks questions such as, Why did this happen? What do I already know about this? What can I find out about this? How can I solve this problem? Shows interest in the topic. Creates interest. Generates curiosity. Raises questions and problems. Elicits responses that uncover student knowledge about the concept/topic. Explore Thinks creatively within the limits of the activity. Tests predictions and hypotheses.

Allows students to assess their learning and group process skills. Asks open-ended questions such as, Why do you think...? What evidence do you have? What do you know about the problem? How would you answer the question? IDS is designed to develop students' computational and statistical thinking skills. Computationally, students will learn to write code to enhance analyses of data, to break large problems into smaller pieces, and to understand and employ algorithms to solve problems. Statistical thinking skills include developing a data \"habit of mind\" in which one learns to seek data to answer questions or support (or undermine) claims; thinking critically about the ability of particular data to support claims; learning to interpret analyses of data; and learning to communicate findings. IDS employs Participatory Sensing to give students control of the data collection process, and to enable them to collect data about things that are important to them. The curriculum is organized around a series of Participatory Sensing \"campaigns\" in which students engage in all stages of the statistical process, which we call the Data Cycle: asking questions, examining and collecting data, analyzing data, interpreting data and, if necessary, beginning again. As students progress, they engage in the Data Cycle in a deeper way. Initially, analysis and interpretation is purely descriptive. Later, randomization-based algorithms and simulations are used to develop notions of inference and to make students more critical of the data collection process. By engaging in the Data Cycle repeatedly in different contexts - some of which include the students' own designs - students will learn to think like data scientists.","title":"The Instructional Philosophy of Introduction to Data Science"},{"location":"overview/#student-team-collaboration","text":"Many of the activities in the IDS curriculum are based on students collaborating with each other. Activities may call on pairs or teams of students. It is imperative that teams and team roles be established as close to the beginning of the course as possible. Expectations about teamwork should be introduced as soon as teams are formed. The ideal team comprises four students. The Teacher Resources section provides a list of instructional strategies and a description of team roles to use for effective student team collaboration. If student teams are unfamiliar with these instructional strategies, it is important for the instructor to take the time to model each strategy.","title":"Student Team Collaboration"},{"location":"overview/#classroom-discussions","text":"Because this is an inquiry-based curriculum, classroom discussion will be especially important. It is important to set classroom discussion norms from the beginning of the course. All students should be encouraged to contribute to the classroom discussion, and the learning environment should be as non-judgmental and as open as possible. Instead of one right answer, most questions in this class have many right answers. In fact, even yes/no questions could have two right answers, both with valid supporting evidence. Teachers should create an environment to help students hold each other accountable so that all voices are heard, meaning that if there are a few students who tend to share a lot, invite them to encourage their peers so other voices can be heard. If there are students who tend to avoid contributing to the class discussion, encourage them to share so that their voices are heard.","title":"Classroom Discussions"},{"location":"overview/#assignments-homework","text":"As much as possible, IDS work will take place in the classroom. Lessons are designed for a 50-60 minute class period. Classes on block schedule will need to complete two lessons; however, it is up to the teacher to decide where to stop in each lesson. There will be open-ended assignments that are sent home. Assignments that require the computer will be completed in class, to avoid the assumption that students have access to computers at home. The exception to this is if a student misses lab time, in which case they will need to find a time to complete the assignment outside of class. As discussed in the software section above, they can use an Internet-enabled computer to do their make-up work. IDS assignments will not be drill-based. Instead, they will follow the inquiry-based instructional model. Again, most questions will not have one right answer. Instead, students will learn to support their claims with evidence and to participate in data-based discussions. Newspaper or other periodical or digital articles are available via links in the lessons. If desired, articles may be downloaded and printed. On average, students will complete a lab assignment in RStudio approximately once per week. It will be at the discretion of the teacher whether or not to collect lab assignments. Calculators should be available every day for students to use. Every day, students will be expected to bring their Data Science (DS) journal, a notebook where they record their notes, work on small assignments, and sketch plots. Teachers may choose to check DS journals and other assignments in the curriculum for credit. End of Unit Projects, oral presentations, and Practicums are designed as application exercises. Scoring guides are provided as an aid for student performance expectations. It will be up to the teacher to score or attach a grade to these assignments.","title":"Assignments &amp; Homework"},{"location":"overview/#overview-of-instructional-topics","text":"The purpose of IDS is to introduce students to dynamic data analysis. The four major components of this curriculum are based on the conceptual categories called upon by the Common Core State Standards High School - Statistics and Probability: I. Interpreting Categorical and Quantitative Data II. Making Inferences and Justifying Conclusions III. Conditional Probability and the Rules of Probability IV. Using Probability to Make Decisions IDS will emphasize the use of statistics and computation as tools for creative work, and as a means of telling stories with data. Seen in this way, its content will also prepare students to \"read\" and think critically about existing data stories. Ultimately, this course will be about how we discern good stories from bad through a practice that involves compiling evidence from one or more sources, and which often requires hands-on examination of one or more data sets. IDS will develop the tools, techniques, and principles for reasoning about the world with data. It will present a process that is iterative and authentically inquiry-based, comparing multiple \"views\" of one or more data sets. Inevitably, these views are the result of some kind of computation, producing numerical summaries or graphical displays. Their interpretation relies on a special kind of computation known as simulation to describe the uncertainty in each view. This kind of reasoning is exploratory and investigatory, sometimes framed as hypothesis evaluation, and sometimes as hypothesis generation.","title":"Overview of Instructional Topics"},{"location":"overview/#interpreting-categorical-and-quantitative-data","text":"A handful of data interpretations are standard. Some, including summaries of shape, center, and spread of one or more variables in a data set - as well as graphical displays like histograms and scatterplots - are standard in the sense that they provide interpretable information in a number of research contexts. They are portable from one set of data to the next, and the rules for their use are simple. And yet, our interpretation of data is rarely \u201cstandard.\u201d Data have no natural look - even a spreadsheet or a table of numbers embeds within it a certain representational strategy. We construct multiple views of data in an attempt to uncover stories about the world. In addition to numerical data, this course will consider time, location, text, and image as data types, and will examine views that uncover patterns or stories. Throughout the course, simulation will be used to calibrate our interpretation of a view, or of a numerical or graphical summary, so that we understand what \u201cstory-less\u201d data (i.e., pure noise, no association) look like. In addition to summaries and simple graphics, students will engage in a modeling practice aligned with the CCSS mathematical practices in order to learn how statistical analyses can explain and describe real-world phenomena. Students will practice fitting and evaluating standard mathematical and statistical models, such as the least-squares regression line. Modeling comes into play when students are asked to design and implement probabilistic simulations in order to test and compare hypothetical chance processes to real-world data.","title":"Interpreting Categorical and Quantitative Data"},{"location":"overview/#making-inferences-and-justifying-conclusions","text":"Data are becoming increasingly plentiful, supported by a host of new \"publication\" techniques or services. Post-Web 2.0, data are interoperable, flowing out of one service and into another, helping us easily build a detailed data version of many phenomena in the world. Reasoning with data, then, starts with the sources and the mechanics of this flow. Which sources do we trust? How do data from different organizations compare? What stories have been told previously with these data, and by whom? This course answers these questions, in part, by using the tools and techniques already mentioned. The ability to read and critique published stories and visualizations are additions to these tools and techniques. Finally, as an act of comparison, students should also be able to formulate questions, identify existing data sets, and evaluate how the new stories stack up against the old. To support this cycle of inquiry, students will examine the basic publication mechanisms for data and develop a set of questions to ask of any data source - computation meets critical thinking. In some cases, data will exhibit special structures that can be used to aid in inference. The simulation techniques for calibrating different views of a data set take on new life when some form of random process was followed to generate the data. Polls, for example, rely on random samples of the population, and clinical trials randomly assign patients to treatment and control groups. A simulation strategy that repeats these random mechanisms can be used to assess uncertainty in the data, assigning a margin of error to poll results, or identifying new drugs that have a \"significant\" effect on some health outcome. In many cases, data will not possess this kind of special origin story. A census, for example, is meant to be a complete enumeration of a population, and we can reason in a very direct way from the data. In other cases, no formal principle was applied, perhaps being a sample \"of convenience.\" The techniques for telling stories from these kinds of data will also rely on a mix of simulation and subsetting. Finally, this course will introduce Participatory Sensing as a technique for collecting data. The idea of a data collection campaign will be introduced as a means of formalizing a question to be addressed with data. Campaigns will be informed by research and data analysis, and will build on, augment, or challenge existing sources. The \"culture\" behind the existing sources and the summaries or views they promote will be part of the classroom discussions. It is worth noting that everything described so far depends on computation, using a piece of statistical software on a computer. Students will be taught simple programming tools for accessing data, creating views or fitting models, and then assessing their importance via simulation. Computation becomes a medium through which students learn about data. The more expressive the language, the more elaborate the stories we can tell.","title":"Making Inferences and Justifying Conclusions"},{"location":"overview/#probability","text":"Since simulation is our main tool for reasoning with data, interpreting the output of simulations requires understanding some basic rules of probability. First and foremost, this course will discuss the ways in which a computer can generate random phenomena (e.g., How does a computer toss a coin?). Simple probability calculations will be used to describe what we expect to see from random phenomena, then students will compare their results to simulations. The point is to both rehearse these basic calculations and to make a formal tie between simulation and theory in simple cases. In that vein, this course will motivate the relationship between frequency and probability. Students will essentially be simulating independent trials and creating summaries of those simulations. In turn, they should understand that the frequency with which an event occurs in a series of independent simulations tends to the probability for that event as the number of simulations gets large (the Law of Large Numbers, a topic that is often taught in introductory statistics courses). From here, students will simulate a variety of random processes to aid in formal statistical inference when some random mechanism was applied as part of the data design. In short, probability becomes a ruler of sorts for assessing the importance of any story we might tell. In this approach to probability, a combination of direct mathematical calculation and computer simulations will be used in order to give students a deep sense of the underlying statistical concepts.","title":"Probability"},{"location":"overview/#topic-outline","text":"This outline describes only the scope of the course; the sequence is described in each unit.","title":"Topic Outline"},{"location":"overview/#i-interpreting-data","text":"A.

While most people think of data simply as a spreadsheet or a table of numbers, almost anything can be considered data, including images, text, GPS coordinates, and much more. Our world has become increasingly data-centric, and we are constantly generating data, whether we know it or not. From posts on Facebook, to shopping records created when you swipe your credit card, to driving over sensors embedded in highway on-ramps, we leave behind a stream of data wherever we go. These data are used to generate stories about our world, whether it is for political forecasting, marketing, scientific research, or even Netflix recommendations. Traditional statistics courses consist of understanding data from only a small subset of data generation processes, namely those collected through random sampling or random assignment in scientific experiments. This unit exposes students to a wider world of data, and will help students see how to make sense of these ubiquitous data types. This unit will motivate the idea that data and data products (charts, graphs, statistics) can be analyzed and evaluated just like other arguments, such as those used by journalists. We want to know how the evidence was collected, what the perspective or bias of the creator might be, and look behind the scenes to the process used to create the product. Even the way data are represented embeds within it decisions on the part of the data creator. Using the techniques of descriptive statistics, students will begin learning how to construct multiple views of data in an attempt to uncover new insights about the world. This will require the introduction of the computational tool R through the interface of RStudio. Standard graphical displays like histograms and scatterplots will be introduced in RStudio, as well as measures of center and spread. Focus Statistics CCSS-M S-ID 1.

Recognize possible associations and trends in the data. S-ID 6. Represent data on two quantitative variables on a scatterplot, and describe how the variables are related. S-IC 6. Evaluate reports based on data.* *This standard is woven throughout the course. It is a recurring standard for every unit. Focus Standards for Mathematical Practices SMP-3.

Upon completion of Unit 1, students will be able to: Give examples of where they leave data traces. Understand that rows and columns are a form of data structure. Explain why the relationship between the variables might exist, or, if there is no relationship, why that might be so. Construct and interpret a frequency table. Critically read reports from media sources to evaluate their claims. Read plots (identify the name of the plot, interpret the axes, look for trends, identify confounding factors). Calculate conditional and marginal probabilities using frequency tables. Provide a real-world explanation for why the conditional or independent probabilities make sense, using critical thinking skills and background knowledge. Communicate their evaluations in written or verbal form using different types of media. Load data into RStudio. Create basic plots in RStudio. Create frequency tables in RStudio. Unit 2 This unit deepens the informal reasoning skills developed in Unit 1 by enriching students' technical vocabulary and developing more precise analytical tools. Most importantly, this unit introduces the formal concept of probability as a tool for understanding that sometimes patterns observed in data are not \"real.\" Traditional courses attempt to develop this understanding through the development of abstract mathematical probability concepts, but IDS creates enduring understanding by teaching students to design and implement simulations using pseudo-random number generators. This activity also develops computational thinking by teaching students about some basic programming structures. Then, the use of models will come to the foreground. Students will be introduced to linear models - the most common form of modeling in introductory statistics classes - which will serve as the foundation to learn more complex modeling techniques that use the computer technology available to them later in the course, including smoothing techniques and tree-based models.

S-ID 3: Interpret differences in shape, center, and spread in the context of the data sets, accounting for possible effects of extreme data points (outliers). S-ID 4. Use the mean and standard deviation of a data set to fit it to a normal distribution and to estimate population percentages. Understand that there are data sets for which such a procedure is not appropriate. Use calculators, spreadsheets, and tables to estimate areas under the normal curve. S-IC 2.

Describe situations where the normal distribution may model the phenomena, and others where it may not. Simulate normal distribution. Simulate from a model. Compare real data to simulation. Determine if model and data appear consistent. Merge data by columns/rows, and verify that merging is successful. Learn for() loops and apply() functions in RStudio. Create functions. Unit 3 Unit 3 focuses on data collection methods, including traditional methods of designed experiments and observational studies and surveys. It introduces students to sampling error and bias, which cause problems in analysis made from survey data. Participatory Sensing is presented as another method of data collection, and students learn to design Participatory Sensing campaigns that will allow them to address particular statistical questions. Participatory Sensing is a unique data collection method because it uses sensors. Furthermore, this method emphasizes the involvement of citizens and community groups in the process of sensing and documenting where they live, work, and play. Triggers play an important role in the Participatory Sensing data collection process. The response to the triggers may or may not be the same each time. Data takes on a variety of forms online and requires a different style of representation. Students enhance computing skills by learning about modern data structures, and by learning to \"scrape\" data stored in XML format. Focus Statistics CCSS-M S-IC 1. Understand statistics as a process for making inferences about population parameters based on a random sample from that population. S-IC 3. Recognize the purposes of and differences among sample surveys, experiments, and observational studies; explain how randomization relates to each. S-IC 6. Evaluate reports based on data.* *This standard is woven throughout the course. It is a recurring standard for every unit. Focus SMPs SMP-1. Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.

Upon completion of Unit 3, students will be able to: Provide a loose definition of \u201cstatistics\u201d in their own words. Compare and contrast population vs. sample. Compare and contrast parameter vs. statistic. Explain the difference between special data structures, particularly as they relate to inference. Exploit special data structures for re-randomization analysis. Explain situations where one measure of central tendency or spread may be more appropriate than others. Read/interpret boxplots (In-depth look into samples size and their relationship to the population parameters). Identify reports that use special data structures (census, survey, observational study, and randomized experiment). Do data scraping. Use HTML and XML formats. Use RStudio to re-randomize data. Compute measures of central tendency and spread in RStudio. Unit 4 This unit will develop modeling skills, beginning with learning to fit and interpret least squares regression lines and learning to use regression to make predictions. Students will learn to evaluate the success of these predictions and so compare models for their predictive accuracy. Modern algorithmic approaches to regression are presented, and students will strengthen algorithmic thinking skills by understanding how and why these algorithms help data scientists make accurate predictions from data. Students engage in a complete modeling experience in which they apply the skills and concepts learned in the previous units. The modeling experience is designed to make students\u2019 thinking visible and audible by encouraging them to be metacognitive about the process of inventing and testing a model, ask questions as they go through the process, and recognize the iterative nature of modeling.

It introduces students to sampling error and bias, which cause problems in analysis made from survey data. Participatory Sensing is presented as another method of data collection, and students learn to design Participatory Sensing campaigns that will allow them to address particular statistical questions. Participatory Sensing is a unique data collection method because it uses sensors. Furthermore, this method emphasizes the involvement of citizens and community groups in the process of sensing and documenting where they live, work, and play. Triggers play an important role in the Participatory Sensing data collection process. The response to the triggers may or may not be the same each time. Data takes on a variety of forms online and requires a different style of representation. Students enhance computing skills by learning about modern data structures, and by learning to \"scrape\" data stored in XML format.","title":"Unit 3"},{"location":"scope/#focus-statistics-ccss-m_2","text":"S-IC 1.

Students will learn to evaluate the success of these predictions and so compare models for their predictive accuracy. Modern algorithmic approaches to regression are presented, and students will strengthen algorithmic thinking skills by understanding how and why these algorithms help data scientists make accurate predictions from data. Students engage in a complete modeling experience in which they apply the skills and concepts learned in the previous units. The modeling experience is designed to make students\u2019 thinking visible and audible by encouraging them to be metacognitive about the process of inventing and testing a model, ask questions as they go through the process, and recognize the iterative nature of modeling.","title":"Unit 4"},{"location":"scope/#focus-statistics-standards","text":"S-IC 2.

The Issue: Although we might take its existence for granted today, the Nutrition Facts label was not always required to be on food packages. It wasn't until 1990 that the Nutrition Labeling Education Act mandated food companies to provide information on food labels to help consumers make wiser choices about what they eat. This raises some interesting questions: 1) Does knowing nutritional information about my snacks help me change my habits? 2) What is my snacking pattern? 3) Do I tend to eat healthy? How do I compare to my class? How does my class compare to the rest of the country? 2. Objectives: Upon completing this campaign, students will have the enduring understanding that interpreting graphs provides useful information about the real world as viewed through the data represented in the graphs. We can explore the relationship between two variables, and if there is a relationship, it is driven by the change in the independent variable, x, which causes a change in the dependent variable, y. 3. Survey Questions: (students will enter data about the snacks they consume): Consider Data: Before students submit a survey for their first snack, a class consensus of the meaning of the variables must be reached so that proper analysis and interpretations can be made. Two examples are listed below: when - If students have different definitions of \" evening \", it might make it hard to compare snacking patterns across students. As a class, come to a consensus about what time intervals are considered morning , afternoon , evening and night . cost - If a student has a bowl of cereal as a snack, are they going to include the cost of the entire box or are they going to calculate the unit cost for one serving?

The Issue: There have been many reports lately about people spending a large amount of time interacting with technology and the Internet. This raises some questions about time use: 1) How do I spend my time? 2) Are there groups that spend more time on certain activities than other groups? 3) How is my time use similar or different to other Americans? 2. Objectives: Upon completing this campaign, students will have compared themselves to the U.S. population to find whether they are similar in some ways and different in other ways. They will use single and multivariable plots, summary statistics, and frequency tables to find similarities and differences between groups of students and between students and other residents of the United States. 3. Survey Questions: (students will enter data for the activities in which they participated): Consider Data: The categories below are similar to the categories found in the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), which provides nationally representative estimates of how Americans spend their time. Having similar variables allows students to compare the way they spend their time to the official ATUS dataset. Before students begin collecting data, it is important to discuss different activities in their day and how they might be classified. A class consensus of the meaning of the variables must be reached so that proper analysis and interpretations can be made. Note: Students cannot double dip their time. For example, if they read during class, then those minutes spent reading do not count towards \u201cread\u201d but instead toward \u201cschool\u201d.

Data are gathered by people and by sensors. Patterns in data can reveal previously unknown patterns in our world. Data play a large, and sometimes invisible, role in our lives. Lesson 2: Stick Figures Data consist of records of particular characteristics of people or objects. Data can be organized in many different ways, and some ways make it easier than others for achieving particular purposes. Lesson 3: Data Structures Variables record values that vary. By organizing data into rectangular format, we can easily see the characteristics of observations by reading across a row, or we can see the variability in a variable by reading down the column. Computers can easily process data when it is in rectangular format. Lesson 4: The Data Cycle A statistical investigation consists of cycling through the four stages of the Data Cycle; statistical questions are questions that address variability and are productive in that they motivate data collection, analysis, and interpretation. The Data Collection phase might consist of collecting data through Participatory Sensing or some other means, or it might consist of examining previously collected data to determine the quality of the data for answering the statistical questions. Data Analysis is almost always done on the computer and consists of creating relevant graphics and numerical summaries of the data. Data Interpretation is involved with using the analysis to answer the statistical questions. Lesson 5: So Many Questions Statistical investigative questions typically begin with a vague general question, then develop into a precise question. The process of developing or creating a good investigative question is iterative and requires time and effort to get right. Lesson 6: What Do I Eat? [The Data Cycle: Consider Data] After raising statistical questions, we examine and record data to see if the questions are appropriate. Lesson 7: Setting the Stage [The Data Cycle: Collect Data] In Participatory Sensing, we humans behave as if we are robot sensors, collecting data whenever a \"trigger\" event occurs. Our ability to learn about the patterns in our life through these data depends on our being reliable data collectors. Lesson 8: Tangible Plots [The Data Cycle: Analyze Data] Distributions organize data for us by telling us (a) which values of a variable were observed, and (b) how many times the values were observed (their frequency). Lesson 9: What Is Typical? The \u201ccenter\u201d of a distribution is a deliberately vague term, but it is one way to answer the subjective question \"what is a typical value?\" The center could be the perceived balancing point or the value that approximately cuts the area of the distribution in half. Lesson 10: Making Histograms Histograms can be created through the use of an algorithm. The distributions displayed in a histogram can be classified using the technical terms for the shapes of distributions. Learning to describe routine tasks through an algorithm is an important component of computational thinking. Lesson 11: What Shape Are You In? Identifying the shape of a histogram is part of the interpret step of the Data Cycle. Lesson 12: Exploring Food Habits Once Participatory Sensing data has been collected, the Dashboard and PlotApp perform the analysis step of the Data Cycle, though humans need to tell the computer which plots to examine. Lesson 13: RStudio Basics The computer has a syntax, and it can only understand if you speak its language. Lesson 14: Variables, Variables, Variables To examine whether two (or more) variables are related, we can plot their distributions on the same graph. Lesson 15: Americans\u2019 Time on Task Learning to examine other analyses is an important part of statistical thinking. Lesson 16: Categorical Associations A two-way table is a summary of the association/relationship between two categorical variables. Joint relative frequencies answer questions of the form \"what proportion of the people/objects had this value on the first variable and this value on the second?\" Lesson 17: Interpreting Two-Way Tables Marginal (relative) frequencies tell us about the distribution of a single variable. Conditional relative frequencies tell us about the distribution of one variable when \"subsetting\" the other.","title":"Essential Concepts"},{"location":"unit1/essential/#ids-unit-1-essential-concepts","text":"","title":"IDS Unit 1: Essential Concepts"},{"location":"unit1/essential/#lesson-1-data-trails","text":"Data are a collection of recorded observations.

Welcome to the labs! Throughout the year, you'll be putting your data science skills to work by completing the labs. You'll learn how to program in the R programming language. \u2013 The programming language used by actual data scientists. Your code will be written in RStudio which is an easy to use interface for coding using R . So let's get started! The data for our first few labs comes from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). \u2013 The CDC is a federal institution that studies public health. Type these two commands into your console: data(cdc) View(cdc) Describe the data that appeared after running View(cdc) : \u2013 Who is the information about? \u2013 What sorts of information about them was collected? To find out more information about the cdc data, type the command below into your console. \u2013 To get back to the slides find and click on the Viewer tab. ?cdc Data: Variables & Observations Data can be broken up into two parts. `1. Observations `2. Variables \u2013 Observations are the who or what we are collecting data from/about. \u2013 Variables are the measurements or characteristics about our observations . If need be, re-type the command you used to View your data. Then answer the following: \u2013 Based on the data, describe a few characteristics about the first observation. \u2013 What does the first column tell us about our observations? In order to describe the first observation, notice that you had to look at the first row of the spreadsheet. Each row, in this case, describes a person. The columns of the spreadsheet represent variables. Uncovering our Data's Structure Now that we've looked at our data, let's look at how RStudio is organized. RStudio's main window is composed of four panes Find the pane that has a tab titled Environment and click on the tab . \u2013 This pane contains a list of everything that's currently available for R to use. \u2013 Notice that R knows we have our cdc data loaded. How many students are in our cdc data set? How many variables were measured for each student? Some New Functions Type the following commands into the console: dim(cdc) nrow(cdc) ncol(cdc) names(cdc) Which of these functions tell us the number of observations in our data? Which of these functions tell us the number of variables? First Steps Typing commands into the console is your first step into the larger world of programming or coding (terms which are often used interchangeably). Coding is all about learning how to send instructions to your computer. \u2013 The way we speak to the computer, using a coding language, syntax . R is one of many coding languages. Each coding language is slightly different, and these differences are reflected in the syntax. Capitalization , spelling and punctuation are REALLY important. Syntax matters Run the following commands. What happens after each command? Names(cdc) NAMES(cdc) names(cdc) names(CDC) Which does R understand? R's most important syntax Most of the commands you will be using follow the syntax below: function (y ~ x, data = ____ ) To create graphs or plots you need to provide R with the following: \u2013 The name of the R function, often the plot\u2019s name, that tells the computer how to create your graph. The variable(s) containing the information we want the function to use. The data set containing the variables. Notice that when we analyze a single variable the value for y is left blank. bargraph(~grade, data = cdc) Later on, we\u2019ll see we can use this syntax to do more than create graphs.

In the previous lab, we started to get acquainted with the layout of RStudio and some of the commands. In this lab, we'll learn about different types of variables. \u2013 Such as those that are measured by numbers and others that have values that are categories. We'll also look at ways to visualize these different types of data using plots (a word data scientists use interchangeably with the word graph ). Find the History tab in RStudio and click on it. Figure out how to use the information to reload the cdc data. Variable Types Numerical variables have values that are measured in units. Categorical Variables have values that describe or categorize our observations. View your cdc data and find the columns for height and gender (use the History pane again if you need help to View your data). \u2013 Is height a numerical or categorical variable? Why? \u2013 Is gender a numerical or categorical variable? Why? \u2013 List either the different categories or what you think the measured units are for height and gender . Which is which? Run the code you used in the previous lab to display the names of your cdc data's variables (Use the code displayed in the History pane to resubmit previously typed commands).

Choose one numeric and one categorical variable from the data and create both a bargraph and a histogram for each variable. \u2013 Which function, either bargraph or histogram , is better at visualizing categorical variables? Which is better at visualizing numerical variables? We have options Make a graph that shows the distribution of people\u2019s weight . \u2013 Describe the distribution of weight . Make sure to describe the shape , center and spread of the distribution. Options can be added to plotting functions to change their appearance. The code below includes the nint option which controls the number of intervals in a numerical plot. \u2013 Options, also known as arguments , are additional pieces of information you provide to a function, and separated by commas.

Do males and females have similar heights? To answer this, what we'd like to do is visualize the distributions of heights, separately, for males and females. \u2013 This way, we can easily compare them.

Whose data? Our data. Throughout the previous labs, we've been using data that was already loaded in RStudio. \u2013 But what if we want to analyze our own data? This lab is all about learning how to load our own participatory sensing data into RStudio. Export, upload, import Before we can perform any analysis, we have to load data into R . When we want to get our participatory sensing data into RStudio, we: \u2013 Export the data from your class\u2019 campaign page. \u2013 Upload data to RStudio server \u2013 Import the data into R's working memory Note: You can watch the following video for a step-by-step walk-through of the process: https://www.youtube.com/embed/4mChtv5qy1g Exporting To begin, go to the IDS Tools page \u2013 Click on the Campaign Manager \u2013 Fill in your username and password and click \"Sign in\". If you forget your username or password, ask your teacher to remind you. Campaign Manager After logging in, your screen should look similar to this. Click on the dropdown arrow for the campaign you are interested in downloading. \u2013 At this point in the course, it will most likely be the Food Habits campaign. Dropdown Arrow The options for the dropdown menu will look like this: Click on the option labeled Export Data. \u2013 Remember where you save your file! Exporting When you clicked the Export link, a .csv file was saved on your computer. Now that the file is on your computer, we need to upload it into RStudio. Uploading Look at the four different panes in RStudio. \u2013 Find the pane with a Files tab. \u2013 Click it! Click the button on the Files pane that says \"Upload\". \u2013 Click on \"Choose File\" and find the SurveyResponses.csv file you saved to your computer. \u2013 Hit the OK button. Voila! \u2013 If you look in the Files pane, you should be able to find your data! Upload vs. Import By Uploading your data into RStudio you've really only given yourself access to it. \u2013 Don't believe me? Look at the Environment pane ... where's your data? To actually use the data we need to Import it into your computer's memory. To compute more quickly and efficiently, R will only keep a few data sets stored in its memory at a time. \u2013 By importing data, you are telling R that this is a data set that is important to store it in its memory so you can use it. Importing On the Files pane, find the data you want to import . Click on the name of the file and choose the option \"Import Data set...\" Data Preview You can give your data a name using the Name: field in the lower left corner. What's in a name? The name you give your data is what you will use when you write code to analyze your data. \u2013 Good names are short and descriptive. \u2013 For your food habits campaign, some good names to use would be \"foodhabits\" or even just \"food\". When you're ready, click the Import button. read.csv() After you click Import you might notice something appeared in your console. data.file <- read_csv(\"~/SurveyResponse.csv\") View(data.file) This is the actual code RStudio uses to read your data when you clicked the Import button. \u2013 So instead of using the RStudio buttons, we can actually Import by writing code similar to what was output into the console! \u2013 This will come in handy later in the course. A word on staying organized... The Files tab has a few other features to help keep you organized. \u2013 SurveyResponse probably isn't the best name for your data.

Data with Clarity Previously, we've looked at graphs of entire variables (by looking at all of their values). \u2013 Doing this is helpful to get a big picture idea of our data. In this lab, we'll learn how to zoom in on our data by learning how to subset. \u2013 We'll also learn a few ways to manipulate the plots we've been making to make them easier to use for analyses. Import the data from your class' Food Habits campaign and name it food . Another plotting function A dotPlot is another plot that can be used to analyze a numerical variable. \u2013 Dotplots are better suited for smaller datasets. If datasets are too large, the dots become too small to see. \u2013 Similarly, distributions with a large spread might impact the readability of the plot. Use the dotPlot() function to create a dotPlot of the amount of sugar in our food data. \u2013 The code to create a dotPlot is exactly like you\u2019d use to make a histogram . \u2013 Make sure to use a capital P in dotPlot . More options While a dotPlot should conserve the exact value of each data point, sometimes it behaves like a histogram in that it lumps values together. Create a more accurate dotPlot by including the nint option. \u2013 Set nint equal to the maximum value for sugar minus the minimum value for sugar plus one. On your food data spreadsheet, click on the sugar header to sort in ascending order (to obtain minimum). Click on the sugar header again to sort in descending order (to obtain maximum). \u2013 Use your History pane to see how we included the option nint with the histogram function. Pro-tip: If the dotPlot comes out looking wonky, try changing the value of the character expansion option, cex . \u2013 The default value is 1 . Try a few values between 0 and 1 and a few more values larger than 1 . Splitting data sets In lab 1B , we learned that we can facet (or split) our data based on a categorical variable. Split the dotPlot displaying the distribution of grams of sugar in two, by faceting on our observations\u2019 salty_sweet variable. \u2013 Describe how R decides which observations go into the left or right plot. \u2013 What does each dot in the plot represent? Altering the layout It would be much easier to compare the sugar levels of salty and sweet snacks if the dotPlots were stacked on top of one another. We can change the layout of our separated plots by including the layout option in our dotPlot function. \u2013 **Add the following option to the code you used to create the dotPlot split by salty_sweet . layout = c(1,2) Hint: Use a similar syntax used with the nint option to add the layout option to the dotPlot function. Subsetting Subsetting is a term we use to describe the process of looking at only the data that conforms to some set of rules: \u2013 Geologists may subset earthquake data by looking at only large earthquakes. \u2013 Stock market traders may subset their trading data by looking only at the previous day's trades. There's many ways to subset data using RStudio, we'll focus on learning the most common methods. The filter function Creating two plots, one for Salty and one for Sweet is useful for comparing Salty and Sweet . What if we want to examine one group by itself? The line of code below creates a subset of the food dataset containing only Salty snacks. We will break it down piece by piece in the next few slides. Run the line of code below: food_salty <- filter(____ , ____ == \"Salty\") View food_salty and write down the number of observations in it. So what's really going on? Coding in R is really just about supplying directions in a way that R understands. \u2013 We'll start by focusing on everything to the right of the \"<-\" symbol food_salty <- filter(____ , ____ == \"Salty\") filter() tells R that we're going to look at only the values in our data that follow a rule . The first blank should be the data we're going to filter down into a smaller set (Based on our rule). salty_sweet == \"Salty\" is the rule to follow. 3 parts of defining rules We can decompose our rule, salty_sweet == \"Salty\" , into 3 parts: (1) salty_sweet , is the particular variable we want to use to select our subset. (2) \"Salty\" is the value of the variable that we want to select. We only want to see data with the value Salty for the variable salty_sweet . (3) == describes how we want to relate our variable ( salty_sweet ) to our value ( \"Salty\" ). In this case, we want values of salty_sweet that are exactly equal to \"Salty\" . Notice: Values (that are also words) have quotation marks around them. Variables do not. More on == We can use the head() function to help us see what's happening when we write salty_sweet == \"Salty\" . \u2013 head() returns the values of the first 6 observations. \u2013 The tail() function returns the last 6 observations. Run the following code and answer the question below: head(~salty_sweet == \"Salty\", data = food) What do the values TRUE and FALSE tell us about how our rule applies to the first six snacks in our data? Which of the first six observations were Salty ? Saving values To use our subset data we need to save it first. \u2013 When we save something in R what we are really doing is giving a value, or set of values, a specific name for us to use later. The arrow <- is called the \"assignment\" operator. It assigns names (on the left) to values (on the right) \u2013 We now focus on everything to the left of, and including, the \"<-\" symbol food_salty <- filter(____ , ____ == \"Salty\") Saving our subset food_salty <- filter(____ , ____ == \"Salty\") This code then: \u2013 takes our subset data, (everything to the right of \"<-\") ... \u2013 and assigns the subset data, by using the arrow \"<-\" ... \u2013 the name food_salty . We can now use food_salty to do anything we could do with the regular food data ... \u2013 but only including those snacks who reported being Salty . As a result of assigning the subset data to food_salty , food_salty now appears in the Environment pane. Whenever data is assigned to a variable name, that variable name will appear in the Environment pane. Use food_salty to make a dotPlot of the sodium in our Salty snacks. Including more filters We often want to filter our data based on multiple rules. \u2013 For instance, we might want to filter our food data based on the food being salty AND having less than 200 calories. We can include multiple filters to our subsets by separating each rule with a comma like so: my_sub <- filter(food , salty_sweet == \"Salty\", calories < 200) View the my_sub data we filtered in the above line of code and verify that it only includes salty snacks that have less than 200 calories. Put it all together Use an appropriate dotPlot to answer each of the following questions: \u2013 About how much sugar does the typical sweet snack have? \u2013 How does the typical amount of sugar compare when healthy_level < 3 and when healthy_level > 3 ? Because you are now working with subsets of data, it is important to label our plots and make this distinction. \u2013 We can use the main option to add a title to our plots Add the following option to the code you used to create the dotPlot of the sugar in Sweet snacks. main = \"Distribution of sugar in sweet snacks\"","title":"Lab 1D: Zooming Through Data"},{"location":"unit1/lab1d/#lab-1d-zooming-through-data","text":"Directions: Follow along with the slides, completing the questions in blue on your computer, and answering the questions in red in your journal.","title":"Lab 1D - Zooming Through Data"},{"location":"unit1/lab1d/#data-with-clarity","text":"Previously, we've looked at graphs of entire variables (by looking at all of their values). \u2013 Doing this is helpful to get a big picture idea of our data.

Why do we call it clean ? \u2013 Variables were named so we could understand what they were about. \u2013 There didn't seem to be any typos in the values. \u2013 Numerical variables were considered numbers. \u2013 Categorical variables were composed of categories. Unfortunately, more often than not, data is messy until YOU clean it. In this lab, we'll learn a few essentials for cleaning dirty data. Messy data? What do we mean by messy data? Variables might have non-descriptive names \u2013 Var01 , V2 , a , ... Categorical variables might have misspelled categories \u2013 \"blue\" , \"Blue\" , \"blu\" , ... Numerical variables might have been input incorrectly . For example, if we're talking about people's height in inches: \u2013 64.7 , 6.86 , 676 , ... Numerical variables might be incorrectly coded as categorical variables (or vice-versa) \u2013 \"64.7\", \"68.6\", \"67.6\" The American Time Use Survey To show you what dirty data looks like, we'll check out the American Time Use Survey , or ATU survey.

New name, same old data To fix the variable names, we need to assign a new set of names in place of the old ones. \u2013 Below is an example of the rename function: atu_cleaner <- rename(atu_dirty, age = V1, gender = V2) Use the example code and the variable information on the previous slide to rename the rest of the variables in atu_dirty . Write down the new names you chose for the rest of the variables in atu_dirty . \u2013 Names should be short, contain no spaces and describe what the variable is related to. So use abbreviations to your heart's content. Next up: Strings In programming, a string is sort of like a word . \u2013 It's a value made up of characters (i.e. letters) The following are examples of strings. Notice that each string has quotes before and after. \"string\" \"A1B2c3\" \"Hot Cocoa\" \"0015\" Numbers are words? (Sometimes) In some cases, R will treat values that look like numbers as if they were strings . Sometimes we do this on purpose. \u2013 For example, we can code Yes/No variables as \"1\" / \"0\" . Sometimes we don't mean for this to happen. \u2013 The number of siblings a person has should not be a string. Look at the str ucture of your data and the variable descriptions from a few slides back: \u2013 Write down the variables that should be numeric but are improperly coded as strings or characters . Changing strings into numbers To fix this problem, we need to tell R to think of our \"numeric\" variables as numeric variables. We can do this with the as.numeric function. \u2013 An example using this function is below: as.numeric(\"3.14\") ## [1] 3.14 Notice: We started with a string, \"3.14\" , but as.numeric was able to turn it back into a number. Mutating in action Look at the variables you thought should be numeric and select one. Then fill in the blanks below to see how we can correctly code it as a number: atu_cleaner <- mutate(atu_cleaner, age = as.numeric(age), ___ = as.numeric(___)) Once you have this code working, use a similar line of code to correctly code the other numeric variables as numbers. Deciphering Categorical Variables We mentioned earlier that we sometimes code categorical variables as numbers. \u2013 For example, our gender variable uses \"01\" and \"02\" for \"Male\" and \"Female\" , respectively. It's often much easier to analyze and interpret when we use more descriptive categories, such as \"Male\" and \"Female\" . Factors and Levels R has a special name for categorical variables, called factors . R also has a special name for the different categories of a categorical variable. \u2013 The individual categories are called levels . To see the levels of gender and their counts type : tally(~gender, data = atu_cleaner) Use similar code as we used above to write down the levels for the three factors in our data. A level by any other name... If we know that '01' means 'Male' and '02' means 'Female' then we can use the following code to recode the levels of gender . Type the following command into your console: atu_cleaner <- mutate(atu_cleaner, gender = recode(gender, \"01\"=\"Male\", \"02\" = \"Female\")) This code is definitely a bit of a mouthful. Let's break it down. Allow me to explain atu_cleaner <- mutate(atu_cleaner, gender = recode(gender, \"01\"=\"Male\", \"02\" = \"Female\")) This code is saying: \u2013 Replace my current version of atu_cleaner ... \u2013 with a mutated one where ... \u2013 the gender variable's levels ... \u2013 have been recoded...\" \u2013 where \"01\" will now be \"Male\" ... \u2013 and \"02\" will now be \"Female\" . Finish it off! Recode the categorical variable about whether the person surveyed had a physical challenge or not. The coding is currently: \u2013 \"01\" : Person surveyed did not have a physical challenge. \u2013 \"02\" : Person surveyed did have a physical challenge. Write a script that: (1) Loads the atu_dirty data set (2) Cleans the the data as we have in this lab (3) Saves a copy of the cleaned data (see next slide). NOTE: You can watch this video to learn about RScripts: https://www.youtube.com/embed/OPqjL9Azmk The final lines The last few lines of your script are extremely important because they will save all of your work. Be sure to View your data and check its str ucture to make sure it looks clean and tidy before saving. Run the code below: atu_clean <- atu_cleaner This code will create a new data frame in your Environment called atu_clean which is a final copy of atu_cleaner . \u2013 If atu_clean is swept from your Environment all of the changes you made will NOT be saved. \u2013 You would need to re-run the script to clean the data again To permanently save your changes you need to save the file as an R data file or .Rda Run the code below: save(atu_clean, file = \"atu_clean.Rda\") Look in your Files pane for the atu_clean.Rda file \u2013 This is as permanent copy of your clean atu data \u2013 To load the data onto your Environment click on the file \u2013 A pop-up window confirming the upload will appear Flex your skills Now that you have learned some cleaning data basics, it\u2019s time to revisit the food data. Run the code below: histogram(~calories | healthy_level, data = food) Use the as.factor() function to convert healthy_level into a categorical variable and re-run the histogram function. \u2013 Notice that the healthy_level categories are now numbers as opposed to tick-marks. This is an improvement but an even better solution would be to recode the categories. Recode the healthy_level categories and re-run the histogram function. \u2013 \"1\" = \"Very Unhealthy\" \u2013 \"2\" = \"Unhealthy\" \u2013 \"3\" = \"Neutral\" \u2013 \"4\" = \"Healthy\" \u2013 \"5\" = \"Very Healthy\" If your food data is cleared from your Environment , the changes that you made to the healthy_level variable will not be saved. To save your changes permanently save your food file as an R data file.","title":"Lab 1F: A Diamond in the Rough"},{"location":"unit1/lab1f/#lab-1f-a-diamond-in-the-rough","text":"Directions: Follow along with the slides, completing the questions in blue on your computer, and answering the questions in red in your journal.","title":"Lab 1F - A Diamond in the Rough"},{"location":"unit1/lab1f/#messy-data-get-used-to-it","text":"Since lab 1, the data we've been using has been pretty clean .

Lesson: Before implementing the IDS curriculum, ensure that: a) Students have been placed in teams and each student understands his or her role in the team. b) Each student knows who his/her partner is within each team. c) Expectations regarding collaborative teamwork are discussed and understood (see Team Roles in Teacher Resources ). Introduce the lesson by showing The Target Story video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvSA-6BJkx4 In pairs, ask students to discuss the following question using the TPS strategy (see Instructional Strategies in Teacher Resources ): How do you think Target knew about the daughter? In other words, how did Target know the daughter was pregnant before her father did? Target used the information gathered from the daughter\u2019s Red Card and compared it to information about other shoppers. Typically, women who bought those particular products were pregnant. After students have had time to share their responses, engage in a whole class discussion regarding: What are data ? Data are information, or observations , that have been gathered and recorded. Where do data come from? Data can come from a variety of places. Some examples might include: cell phones, computers, school records, surveys, etc. Give an example of data. Answers will vary. One example might be information about a person \u2013 including their age, height, weight, eye color, etc. Give an example of something that is not data (e.g., something that was never written down). Answers will vary. One example might be just watching an event happen. If it wasn\u2019t recorded in some way, it cannot be counted as data. Explain to the students that we create \"data trails\" as we go through life. A data trail is the data collected about us as individuals that could be used to see the patterns in our personal lives. Inform the students that they will learn about their own data trails by keeping a data diary and logging entries over the next 24 hours. It is likely that students do not realize how often they leave a data trail or what information is being collected about them on a regular basis. Distribute the Data Diary handout ( LMR_1.1 ) and be sure to go over the instructions, along with the first example to give the students an idea of how to proceed.

Be prepared to facilitate a good discussion and to ask probing questions in order for students to elaborate on their thinking so that vague responses such as \u201cwe learned about data\u201d can be avoided. Homework Students will complete the Data Diary handout. When grading the homework, be aware of whether the data really could be collected, and whether the students' ideas about how the data might be used are reasonable. For instance, students will often imagine that there is a \"spy\" watching them; this is not what we are after. We are after actual instances in which sensors or electronic surveillance records their actions or records information about them. For example, \"someone saw me going into the store\" is not valid data for this exercise, but \"a camera recorded me entering the store\" is valid data.","title":"Lesson 1: Data Trails"},{"location":"unit1/lesson1/#lesson-1-data-trails","text":"","title":"Lesson 1: Data Trails"},{"location":"unit1/lesson1/#objective","text":"Students will understand what are data, how they are collected, and possible effects of sharing data.","title":"Objective:"},{"location":"unit1/lesson1/#materials","text":"Video: The Target Story found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvSA-6BJkx4 https://www.youtube.com/embed/XvSA-6BJkx4 Data Science (DS) journal (quad-ruled composition book or similar); MUST be available for every lesson Data Diary handout ( LMR_1.1_Data Diary ) Video: Terms and Conditions found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcjtEKNP05c https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZcjtEKNP05c","title":"Materials:"},{"location":"unit1/lesson1/#vocabulary","text":"data observations data trails privacy","title":"Vocabulary:"},{"location":"unit1/lesson1/#essential-concepts","text":"Essential Concepts: Data are a collection of recorded observations.

Materials: Peanut butter Jelly Loaf of sliced bread Butter knife Plate Sleep dotplots (from lesson 9 ) Poster paper Markers Vocabulary: algorithm histogram bin(s) bin widths output input left-hand rule right-hand rule Essential Concepts: Essential Concepts: Histograms can be created through the use of an algorithm. The distributions displayed in a histogram can be classified using the technical terms for the shapes of distributions. Learning to describe routine tasks through an algorithm is an important component of computational thinking. Lesson: Inform students that they will be telling us how to make a sandwich today. Giving clear, concise instructions to others is an important skill for students to learn. In this activity, students will practice using descriptive vocabulary, communicating ideas to others, recognizing steps in a process, and recognizing the importance of the use of clear language. Prepare for this task by gathering the necessary materials for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and arranging them in a way that makes them easy to use. You may want to wear an apron and have a trash bag smock \u2014this can get messy but that\u2019s most of the fun! Note: Be aware of peanut allergies! If any of your students are allergic to peanut butter, DO NOT ALLOW STUDENTS TO HANDLE THE PEANUT BUTTER! Peanut allergies can be very serious and children can have reactions without even eating it. So be aware and be careful! Ask your students if they have ever followed a recipe before. What kinds of things have they made? Does anyone know how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich? Would they teach you how? Would they give you all the steps to make a sandwich? Show your students the materials you have for making a sandwich. Have students take out paper and pencils and ask each student (or pair of students) to write down their instructions for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. We can also call these instructions an algorithm . Explain to students that precise instructions for any process are like a formula to follow in order to get the same results each time. Also, an algorithm is how we communicate with the computer. The teacher will function as the computer. Your job is to give him/her rules so that he/she can carry out and successfully make a PB&J sandwich. Every algorithm needs input and produces output. The output here will be a PB&J sandwich. What is the input? Steps, or actions to follow. Tell students that when they are done you will select someone to share their instructions and you will make a sandwich following the instructions. Select a student to read their instructions, and do EXACTLY what it says. For example, if it says \u201cput the peanut butter on the bread,\u201d you can literally put the jar of peanut butter on the bag of bread. There was no instruction to open the bread or the jar of peanut butter, no instruction to use the knife in any way, etc. Listen for other examples of unclear instructions and think of how you might act them out. If students are not clear about where to spread the peanut butter, put it on the crust. The more literal you are by doing exactly what the instructions say, the funnier the activity will be and the more likely you are to get your point across about the importance of clear instructions. After your first sandwich, ask you students if they think their instructions were clear or not. What are some things they might have done differently? Select another student to read his/her instructions. They will be sure to use clarifications of the instructions you acted upon before - this is a good thing! After your finish the sandwich, ask you students if they think clear instructions are important. Why? Let students know that they will now develop an algorithm for building a histogram to represent the sleep dotplots they created in the previous lesson. Explain that a histogram , rather than showing the frequency for each value, shows the frequency (or percent, but we will focus on frequency) of all the values that fall in a certain range, called a bin . For example, we might choose bins that go from 0-5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-20, 20-25. Bin widths will vary by class. Model how to create a histogram using the data from the dotplot \u201chours of sleep last night\u201d. On a blank chart, create the x-axis with bin widths 0-3, 3-6, 6-9, etc. and place marks on the plot at those intervals and ask students: \u201cWhat are the frequencies in each bin?\u201d Notice that multiples of three appear in more than one bin. Let\u2019s take the value of 6 hours as an example. Should those observations be included in the second bin (3-6) or the third bin (6-9)? If students include the values of 6 hours in the second bin then they are using the left-hand rule . If students include the values of 6 hours in the third bin then they are using the right-hand rule . Once the frequencies have been determined, draw the bars with corresponding heights. Do not include spaces between the bars as time is a continuous variable. Next, student teams will create an algorithm that gives directions for how to construct a histogram for the data from the dotplot for \u201chours of sleep they hope to get on Saturday.\u201d Remember, an algorithm is a set of rules that can always be applied. Similar to the way they wrote a process for making a PB&J sandwich, students will write a process for creating a histogram. Tell students to continue thinking of the process to transform the data in the dotplot to create a histogram. The algorithm will produce an output , which will be a histogram. What's the input ? Data, or maybe the dotplot. Inform the students that you will provide a piece of input: how wide the bin will be. For instance, it might be 5 hours, it might be 1 hour, or it might be 10 hours (or half an hour!). Whatever it is, their algorithm should work for any input value. Let students work for a bit. They should write out Step 1, Step 2, etc. Then choose a group and ask them to get you started. Give them a bin width of 4. Teachers should sketch the histogram on the board or chart paper as students read their algorithms. Again, teachers should take things very literally. For example, if they do not tell you exactly where the bins should start, start one way off to the left. If they are vague and say \"divide the number line into groups of 10,\u201d then make them arbitrary sizes. If they have to be the same size, ask them how to do that. Points to consider: Where do we start drawing the bins? Always at the location of the smallest dotplot? Always at the greatest? A little to the left? What do we do with points that fall exactly on a boundary? Do they go to the bin on the left or on the right? Does it matter? No. Can we do it differently every time? No. We need to be consistent. This is called either the left-hand rule or the right-hand rule, depending on which is chosen. After following 2 or 3 algorithms, ask students if they feel their algorithm is precise enough. Allow students time to revise their algorithms. Have a class discussion about the similarities and differences between the original dotplot and a histogram. Ask: What have we gained from the histogram? We now can see the shape of the distribution as a whole. What have we lost? We lost each individual observation by grouping them into bins. Class Scribes: One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were. Homework Students should continue to collect nutritional facts data using the Food Habits Participatory Sensing campaign on their smart devices or via web browser.","title":"Lesson 10: Making Histograms"},{"location":"unit1/lesson10/#lesson-10-making-histograms","text":"","title":"Lesson 10: Making Histograms"},{"location":"unit1/lesson10/#objective","text":"Students will understand that a histogram represents observations grouped into bins, and that bars are drawn to show how many observations (or what proportion of the observations) lie in each bin, rather than representing individual observations, as in a dotplot.","title":"Objective:"},{"location":"unit1/lesson10/#materials","text":"Peanut butter Jelly Loaf of sliced bread Butter knife Plate Sleep dotplots (from lesson 9 ) Poster paper Markers","title":"Materials:"},{"location":"unit1/lesson10/#vocabulary","text":"algorithm histogram bin(s) bin widths output input left-hand rule right-hand rule","title":"Vocabulary:"},{"location":"unit1/lesson10/#essential-concepts","text":"Essential Concepts: Histograms can be created through the use of an algorithm.

See video here . Lesson: Inform students that the Dashboard and PlotApp are data visualization tools that are coded in R, the statistical programming software that academics and professional statisticians use. The Introduction to Data Science course will utilize RStudio, which also runs on R. They will learn the programming language of RStudio for data analysis. Demonstrate how to access RStudio/Posit Cloud by projecting the URL: https://portal.idsucla.org on a screen. Then, click on the RStudio (Posit Cloud) icon on the page. Inform students that they will log into RStudio/Posit Cloud using the \"Log In with Google\" option. Note that this is not the same as their IDS App & IDS Homepage login. Once logged in, show each pane , or rectangular area, of the RStudio/Posit Cloud interface: preview (spreadsheet) - where they will be able to see the variables and observations (index); rows and columns of data console - where they will be entering their code plot - where their plots/graphs/visualizations will be generated environment - where they will see values and objects Inform students that they will be looking at a data set from The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a government agency that collects data about teenagers on a variety of topics. Demonstrate how to load and view the CDC data file to the workspace by typing the following command in the console: >data(cdc) >View(cdc) Examine the environment pane. Ask a student to describe how the data are displayed. The data are displayed in rows and columns. Demonstrate how to list the variables found in the CDC data set. Students may take notes and write down commands in their DS journals: >names(cdc) Ask: What do you notice? What is one variable of this data set? How many variables are there? How does this output compare to the information in the preview pane? This command lists the names of each variable in the data set. Demonstrate how to obtain more detailed information about the data set by typing the following command in the console >help(cdc) Ask: What unit of measurement is height reported in? Height was reported in meters. Demonstrate how to find the number of rows and columns in the data set. >dim(cdc) Ask: Which number do you think represents the rows? Which one represents the columns? How does this output compare to the information in the preview and environment panes? How many observations are there in the data set? How many variables does this data set contain? There are 13,677 rows, or 13,677 observations; and there are 30 columns, or 30 variables. This information is also visible in the preview pane. Next, show students how to access the number of observations of a specific variable. >tally(~seat_belt, data = cdc) Ask: What do you notice? Describe the output. Notice that six categories are displayed. Each category shows the number of observations contained in it. E.g,. \u201cNever\u201d has 294 observations, meaning 294 teens reported never wearing their seat belt as a passenger in a motor vehicle. <NA> = Not Available, represents teens that did not provide information about their seat belt habits. Change the variable to height. >tally(~height, data = cdc) Ask: What do you notice? Describe the output. The levels are missing. It happened because the variable height contains numbers, not categories. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the variables seat_belt and height. Maximize the console. Ask teams to discuss the following question: What is the difference between the data from the variables seat_belt and height? The data from the seat_belt variable is categorical, which means it consists of groupings. The data from the variable height is numerical, which means it consists of numbers. Summarize: In data science, the variable seat_belt is what we call a categorical variable , and the variable height is what we call a numerical variable . Let\u2019s look at the other variables in this data set. In pairs, categorize each variable as categorical or numerical: eat_fruit (categorical) weight (numerical) grade (categorical) gender (categorical) Inform students that they will be learning RStudio code to work with data.

Vocabulary: two-way frequency table joint relative frequency Essential Concepts: Essential Concepts: A two-way table is a summary of the association/relationship between two categorical variables. Joint relative frequencies answer questions of the form \"what proportion of the people/objects had this value on the first variable and this value on the second.\" Lesson: Launch the lesson by displaying the following scenario: Rosa has a theory that cat owners are also musical. To find out, she decided to collect data that would help her understand the relationship between cat ownership and instrument playing among the students in her art class. She conducted a survey and found that out of the 35 students in her art class, 16 owned a cat and out of those that owned a cat, 7 played an instrument. She also discovered that 9 owned a cat, but did not play an instrument. There were also 9 students who neither owned a cat nor played an instrument. Inform students that Rosa asked two questions that provided the data for her two-way frequency table. What could those two questions be? Possible Answer: Question 1\u2014Do you play an instrument? Question 2\u2014Do you own a cat? What variables did Rosa collect? What were the values of those variables? In pairs, write out on paper what the original data must have looked like. Answer: Variable 1: Owns Cat. Variable 2: Plays Instrument Owns Cat Plays Instrument Yes Yes (There are 7 of these) Yes No (9 of these) No Yes (10 of these) No No (9 of these) Inform students that today they will be looking at associations in categorical variables. Note: If necessary, review the difference between questions for categorical and numerical variables. Explain that their task is to summarize Rosa\u2019s findings in one table that shows totals. Remind students to use their knowledge of data structures from Lesson 2 , especially organizing in rows and columns. Allow time for teams to wrestle with how to organize their data in one table. As teams work, walk around monitoring their data tables. Select a few data tables to display and share with the entire class. Explain the Anonymous Author strategy to students (see Instructional Strategies in Teacher Resources ). Display the data tables and ask students to engage in the Anonymous Author strategy. You may want to start the discussion by asking about the total number of students Rosa surveyed. Make sure the last data table you display correctly shows a two-way frequency table . A two-way frequency table displays the data that pertains to two categories from one group. One category is represented in rows and the other is represented in columns. In this exercise, the group is a class of art students. Cat Ownership and Instruments Plays an instrument Does not play instrument Total Owns a cat 7 9 16 No cats 10 9 19 Total 17 18 35 Based on the Cat Ownership and Instruments table, ask student teams to generate questions that can be asked and answered by the data. In a Whip Around , ask student teams to share one of their questions. Explain that a two-way frequency table can show relative frequencies. A relative frequency is how often something occurs in relation to the total number of occurrences, and is expressed as a proportion or percentage of a total. For example, what is the relative frequency of those who own a cat and play an instrument? Answer: 7/35 or 0.2 or 20%. Note: Review how to write a proportion and how to express a proportion as a percent. Ask students to calculate the relative frequencies for the entire table.

Ask: How many active users are there? How many inactive users are there? See Total Responses . How many responses have been submitted? Using TPS, ask students to think about what can they do to increase their data collection. Remind students that this is the last day to collect data. Ask student teams to take out the 2 questions and the two-way table that they created in the previous day\u2019s lesson. Before teams ask the class their questions, ask them to strategize about how they will collect and record their data, because they can only ask the 2 questions. Students in the class will respond to each question by raising their hands. In a Whip Around , have each team ask their 2 questions. Pause briefly between teams so that the asking team has time to collect and record their data. Students will use their frequency tables before the end of the lesson. Recall that in the previous lesson, students learned to calculate relative frequencies. Now it\u2019s time to look at other ways of understanding a two-way frequency table. Display the Cat Ownership and Instruments table: Cat Ownership and Instruments Plays an instrument Does not play instrument Total Owns a cat 7 9 16 No cats 10 9 19 Total 17 18 35 Suppose that we want to know the following information (display questions): How many students own a cat? 16 What is the proportion of students who own a cat? 16/35 \u2248 0.46 What is the proportion of students who do not play an instrument? 18/35 \u2248 0.51 In teams, discuss where on the table you would find this information and how you would calculate it. The specific answers are not important; but what is important is to know how to obtain the information. Possible answer: You would find the proportion of students who do not play an instrument by dividing the number in the \u201cTotal\u201d row that is in the \"Does not play instrument\" column by the total number of students (35). After a few minutes, ask a team to volunteer a response. Mark up the margins on the table to show that the cells with the initial total counts are called marginal frequencies . Note: 10 b and c are marginal relative frequencies. Now suppose that we want to know the following information (display questions): How many students own a cat and play an instrument? 7 What is the proportion of students that own a cat and play and instrument? 7/35=0.2 What is the proportion of students who do not own a cat and play an instrument? 10/35 \u2248 0.286 In teams, discuss where on the table you would find this information and how you would calculate it. The specific answers are not important; but what is important is to know how to obtain the information. Possible answer: You would find the answers in the cells that make up the body of the table. The value for each proportion is the frequency for each cell over the total number of observations. After a few minutes, ask a team to volunteer a response. Mark up the cells in the body of the table to show that the cells with the initial counts are called joint frequencies . Note: 13 b and c are joint relative frequencies. Finally, suppose that we wanted to answer the question: Do a greater proportion of students in Rosa\u2019s art class who do not own cats prefer to play an instrument than those who do own cats? In teams, discuss where on the table you would find this information and how you would calculate it. The specific answers are not important; but what is important is to know how to obtain the information. After a few minutes, ask a team to volunteer a response. Encourage students to agree or disagree with the explanations provided. Lead students to see that the total for the \u201cNo cats\u201d row is important because we are only concerned with that subset of the group. Mark up \u201cNo cats\u201d row on the table to show that we have conditioned, or are bound, by this variable. Compare the values that show the conditional relative frequency for the row. More non-cat owners slightly prefer to play an instrument (display table below). Cat Ownership and Instruments Conditional Relative Frequencies by Row Plays an instrument Does not play instrument Total Owns a cat 7/16 \u2248 0.44 9/16 \u2248 0.56 16/16 \u2248 1.00 No cats 10/19 \u2248 0.53 9/19 \u2248 0.47 19/19 \u2248 1.00 Total 17/35 \u2248 0.49 18/35 \u2248 0.51 35/35 = 1.00 Note: This is a conditional relative frequency by row. We can also calculate conditional relative frequencies by column if we were interested in knowing the difference in cat preference for those who play instruments versus those who don\u2019t. Distribute one full set of cards from the Analyzing Categorical Variables file ( LMR_1.18 ) to each student team. Advanced preparation required: Print the Analyzing Categorical Variables file ( LMR_1.18 ). The handouts can then be cut into a total of 20 cards (12 visuals, 8 numerical summaries). You will need enough sets of the cards for each student team to share one full set. For example, if there are 5 student teams in a class, then 5 copies of the file will need to be printed so that each team gets all 20 cards. LMR_1.18 Distribute LMR_1.19_ Interpreting Categorical Variables to each student team. LMR_1.19 Each student team will work together and decide which visualization(s) and numerical summaries can be used to answer each statistical question. They will then answer each statistical question, citing a numerical summary as evidence. Note: Student teams may tape or glue visuals and numerical summaries onto LMR_1.19 , or they can simply write the plot letter and table number in the appropriate box. The blank column is for student teams to write a statistical question than can be answered with a visual and a numerical summary that was not used. After student teams have been allotted ample time to complete LMR_1.19 , lead a class discussion to go over the answers. It is extremely important to have students justify their answers by referring to their visuals and tables. For example, the statistical question \u201cHow many students neither own a cat or play an instrument?\u201d can be answered with Plot E, Plot G, Plot K, Plot I, and with Tables 1 and 7. Ask students to refer back to the two-way frequency tables they created earlier. Have each team create one poster that shows their two-way frequency table. Then, ask each team to ask 4 questions about the data in their table that must be answered by a: marginal frequency marginal relative frequency joint relative frequency conditional relative frequency (either by row or column) If time permits, pair teams up and ask them to present their findings to each other. Class Scribes: One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.

The specific answers are not important; but what is important is to know how to obtain the information. Possible answer: You would find the answers in the cells that make up the body of the table. The value for each proportion is the frequency for each cell over the total number of observations. After a few minutes, ask a team to volunteer a response. Mark up the cells in the body of the table to show that the cells with the initial counts are called joint frequencies . Note: 13 b and c are joint relative frequencies. Finally, suppose that we wanted to answer the question: Do a greater proportion of students in Rosa\u2019s art class who do not own cats prefer to play an instrument than those who do own cats? In teams, discuss where on the table you would find this information and how you would calculate it. The specific answers are not important; but what is important is to know how to obtain the information. After a few minutes, ask a team to volunteer a response. Encourage students to agree or disagree with the explanations provided. Lead students to see that the total for the \u201cNo cats\u201d row is important because we are only concerned with that subset of the group. Mark up \u201cNo cats\u201d row on the table to show that we have conditioned, or are bound, by this variable. Compare the values that show the conditional relative frequency for the row. More non-cat owners slightly prefer to play an instrument (display table below). Cat Ownership and Instruments Conditional Relative Frequencies by Row Plays an instrument Does not play instrument Total Owns a cat 7/16 \u2248 0.44 9/16 \u2248 0.56 16/16 \u2248 1.00 No cats 10/19 \u2248 0.53 9/19 \u2248 0.47 19/19 \u2248 1.00 Total 17/35 \u2248 0.49 18/35 \u2248 0.51 35/35 = 1.00 Note: This is a conditional relative frequency by row. We can also calculate conditional relative frequencies by column if we were interested in knowing the difference in cat preference for those who play instruments versus those who don\u2019t. Distribute one full set of cards from the Analyzing Categorical Variables file ( LMR_1.18 ) to each student team. Advanced preparation required: Print the Analyzing Categorical Variables file ( LMR_1.18 ). The handouts can then be cut into a total of 20 cards (12 visuals, 8 numerical summaries). You will need enough sets of the cards for each student team to share one full set. For example, if there are 5 student teams in a class, then 5 copies of the file will need to be printed so that each team gets all 20 cards. LMR_1.18 Distribute LMR_1.19_ Interpreting Categorical Variables to each student team. LMR_1.19 Each student team will work together and decide which visualization(s) and numerical summaries can be used to answer each statistical question. They will then answer each statistical question, citing a numerical summary as evidence. Note: Student teams may tape or glue visuals and numerical summaries onto LMR_1.19 , or they can simply write the plot letter and table number in the appropriate box. The blank column is for student teams to write a statistical question than can be answered with a visual and a numerical summary that was not used. After student teams have been allotted ample time to complete LMR_1.19 , lead a class discussion to go over the answers. It is extremely important to have students justify their answers by referring to their visuals and tables. For example, the statistical question \u201cHow many students neither own a cat or play an instrument?\u201d can be answered with Plot E, Plot G, Plot K, Plot I, and with Tables 1 and 7. Ask students to refer back to the two-way frequency tables they created earlier. Have each team create one poster that shows their two-way frequency table. Then, ask each team to ask 4 questions about the data in their table that must be answered by a: marginal frequency marginal relative frequency joint relative frequency conditional relative frequency (either by row or column) If time permits, pair teams up and ask them to present their findings to each other.","title":"Lesson:"},{"location":"unit1/lesson17/#class-scribes","text":"One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.","title":"Class Scribes:"},{"location":"unit1/lesson17/#homework-next-day","text":"Using the data below, generate 2 questions: one must be answered with a marginal relative frequency and the other must be answered by a conditional relative frequency.

Materials: DS journals (must be available during every lesson) Stick Figures cutouts (see lesson 2 ) Vocabulary: variables numerical variables categorical variables rows columns rectangular or spreadsheet format variability Essential Concepts: Essential Concepts: Variables record values that vary. By organizing data into rectangular format, we can easily see the characteristics of observations by reading across a row, or we can see the variability in a variable by reading down the column. Computers can easily process data when it is rectangular format. Lesson: Remind students that they briefly learned what variables are during the previous lesson. Have students create their own definitions of the term \u201cvariables\u201d and share their responses with their teams. Select a few students in the class to share out their definitions and discuss what could be modified (if anything) to create a more complete definition. Using the Stick Figure information from Lesson 2 , allow the class to come up with a set of variable names that describe the different categories of information. Note that it is best when variable names are short (one to three words). The variable names for the Stick Figures data could possibly be: Name Height GPA Shoe or Shoe Type Sport Friends or Number of Friends Next, have a class discussion about how the values from \u201cShoe\u201d are different than the values from \u201cHeight.\u201d The values from \u201cShoe\u201d are either \u201csneakers\u201d or \u201csandals\u201d. Note: Other terms for these shoes are acceptable \u2013 e.g., tennis shoes, flip flops, closed-toe, open-toe, etc. The values from \u201cHeight\u201d are 72, 68, 61, 66, 65, 61, 67, and 64. Students should notice that the \u201cShoe\u201d variable consists of categories or groupings, and the \u201cHeight\u201d variable consists of numbers. Therefore, we can classify variables into two types: categorical variables and numerical variables . Typically, categorical variables represent values that have words, while numerical variables represent values that have numbers. Note: Categorical variables can sometimes be coded as numbers (e.g., \u201cGender\u201d could have values 0 and 1, where 0=Male and 1=Female). As a class, determine which variables from the Stick Figures data are numerical, and which variables are categorical.

Sport Explain that although we can understand many different representations of data (as evidenced by the posters from Lesson 2 ), computers are not as capable. Instead, we need to organize data in a structured way so that a computer can read and interpret them. One way to organize the data is to create a data table that consists of rows and columns . We can define this type of organization as rectangular format , or spreadsheet format . Display a generic table on the board (see example below) and explain that the columns are the vertical portions of the table, while the rows are the horizontal portions. Another way to think of it is that columns go from top to bottom, and rows go from left to right. Ask students: What should each row represent? Each row should represent one observation, or one stick figure person in this case. What should each column represent? Each column should represent one variable. As you go down a column, all the values represent the same characteristic (e.g., Height). On the board, draw the following table and have the students copy it into their DS journals (be sure to use variable names agreed upon by the class): In teams, students should complete the data table using all 8 of the Stick Figures cards. Each row of the table should represent one person on a card. Engage the class in a discussion with the following questions: Do any of the people in the data have the same value for a given variable? In other words, does a value appear more than once in a column? Give two examples. Answers will vary. One example could be that Dakota, Kamryn, Emerson, and London all wear sneakers. Another example could be that Charlie and Jessie are both 61 inches tall. Do any of the people in the data have different values for a given variable? Absolutely. There are many instances of this in the data table. Discuss the term variability . As in question (b) above, the values for each variable vary depending on which person we are observing. This shows that the data has variability, and the first step in any investigation is to notice variability. We can see the relationship between the terms variable and variability .

The term statistical questions encompasses the variety of questions asked during the statistical problem-solving process which support statistical thinking and reasoning. Statistical investigative questions are perhaps the most important because they are challenging to learn and are the types of questions that determine whether an analysis is productive or not. Statistical investigative questions are questions that address variability and are productive in that they motivate data collection, analysis, and interpretation. The Data Collection phase might consist of collecting data through Participatory Sensing or some other means, or it might consist of examining previously collected data to determine the quality of the data for answering the statistical investigative questions. Data Analysis is almost always done on the computer and consists of creating relevant graphics and numerical summaries of the data. Data Interpretation is involved with using the analysis to answer the statistical investigative questions. Lesson: During the past few lessons, we have discussed what data are, how to collect and organize them, and how their values can vary. But what do we do with all this data? How can we navigate it and turn it into something useful to us? Inform students that they will be learning about the Data Cycle today. The Data Cycle is a guide we can use when learning to think about data. We usually start with posing statistical investigative questions. Display the graphic from The Data Cycle file ( LMR_1.3 ): LMR_1.3 Display the Data Cycle on the board or on a projector, and give a brief explanation of the 4 components (listed below). Note: we will explore each component of the Data Cycle more explicitly throughout the course. Pose Statistical Investigative Questions: Statistical investigative questions are questions that address variability and can be answered with data. Consider Data: This is the process of observing and recording data, or of examining previously collected data to make sure it meets the needs of the investigation. Analyze Data: During analysis, tables, graphs, and summaries of the data are produced to help us find patterns and relationships. Interpret Data: The statistical investigative questions are answered by referring to the tables, graphs, and summaries made in the Data Analysis phase. Almost all statistical investigations begin with statistical investigative questions. There are times when the questions may be given to us, so we might start at the data collection step, but this should ideally be our starting point. As an example, explain that you might ask a person \u201cHow old are you?\u201d Although this is a question, it is NOT a statistical investigative question because we are only asking one person so there is no variability in the data. The question \u201cHow old are you?\u201d is a survey question that you might ask if you were trying to answer the investigative question: \u201cHow old are the students in my school?\u201d We would need to collect data to answer the question and we would expect student\u2019s ages to vary. To help students get a firm understanding of the Data Cycle and how each component is connected, they will participate in a Four Corners strategy (see Instructional Strategies in Teacher Resources ). Write down the name of each stage of the Data Cycle on a sheet of paper and include the description of that particular stage (see step 3 for descriptions). Then tape each sheet on a different corner of your room. Explain to the students that you are going to display different artifacts from statistical investigations on the projector. For each artifact, they will move to the corner of the room they feel that artifact represents (posing a statistical investigative question, consider data, analyze data, interpret data). If you have limited space in your classroom or for students that cannot physically participate, you might consider printing LMR_1.4_Data Cycle Spinners . Students can participate by pointing to the spinner. Once students have chosen a corner of the room (stage of the Data Cycle) they will discuss the following with their classmates in that same corner: What part of the data cycle does the artifact represent (posing a statistical investigative question, consider data, analyze data, interpret data)? Why do we think that? What questions or wonderings do we have about the artifact? Allow each group time to discuss the questions and have one member from each team (corner) share the answers to the questions. This activity is not about having a correct answer. It is about having students begin to think critically about statistical artifacts that they are constantly consuming. Data are encountered through visualizations, reports from scientific studies, journalists\u2019 articles and websites. This activity is meant to begin to develop students' statistical habits of mind. Artifact 1: Spreadsheet of the CDC data Note: You can display this spreadsheet using RStudio by running the following commands: data(cdc) View(cdc) What part of the data cycle does the artifact represent (posing a statistical investigative question, consider data, analyze data, interpret data)? Why do we think that? Answers will vary. What questions or wonderings do we have about the artifact? Students should begin developing statistical habits of mind. They should be interrogating the data by asking questions such as: Who is the data about? What was the purpose of collecting the data? What was the survey question asked to collect the data? Artifact 2: Article headline People Who Order Coffee Black Are More Likely To Be Psychopaths What part of the data cycle does the artifact represent (posing a statistical investigative question, consider data, analyze data, interpret data)? Why do we think that? Answers will vary. What questions or wonderings do we have about the artifact? Students should be interrogating this headline with questions like: What type of study was this? Who funded the study? What was the purpose of the study? How was the variable measured? Artifact 3: Dude Map found at (open in new tab): https://qz.com/316906/the-dude-map-how-american-men-refer-to-their-bros/ What part of the data cycle does the artifact represent (posing a statistical investigative question, consider data, analyze data, interpret data)? Why do we think that? Answers will vary. What questions or wonderings do we have about the artifact? Students should be asking questions like: What was the purpose of this study? What variables were measured and how were they measured? Inform students that the Dude Map was created for the Quartz website by Nikhil Sonnad as a data visualization. He collected the data via Twitter. The graphic shows how common the terms: bro, buddy, dude, fella and pal are when referring to friends throughout the United States. Ask students to return to their seats, take out their DS journal and make a sketch of the Data Cycle making sure to include the names of the four stages (Pose statstical investigative question, consider data, analyze data, interpret data). Ask students to write Dude Map under the analyze data of their data cycle and the information about where the data came from (see #13) in the consider data part of their Data Cycle sketch. Have each team discuss a possible investigative question that could be answered using the Dude Map graphic. Have the reporter/recorder write the question on a sticky note and the resource manager bring it up to the board. Lead a class discussion around the investigative questions the student teams created, and as a class, choose one to write down as an example. Example: Where in the United States is the term dude more common to use when referring to a friend? Allow the teams to work together to answer the investigative question. Ask the reporter/recorder to share their team's interpretation. Have students write down the answer that resonated the most with them under the interpret part of the data cycle. Assign ONE of the pages from the Bros & Dudes Graphics handout ( LMR_1.5 ) to each team. There are 10 different versions of word pairings (10 combinations of 2 words chosen from the 5 options), so multiple teams will have the same graphic if there are more than 10 teams in a class. LMR_1.5 The goal of this activity is for each team to complete a full statistical investigation with the Bros & Dudes Graphics assigned to them. Tell the teams that they need to create a Data Cycle poster using their assigned graphic for the analyze stage. The cycle should be clearly labeled and have appropriate responses for each of the 4 components. For example, a team given the \u201cBro\u201d and \u201cBuddy\u201d graphics might come up with the following questions: Which region of the US is most likely to use the term \u201cBro\u201d when referring to a friend?

The term statistical questions encompasses the variety of questions asked during the statistical problem-solving process which support statistical thinking and reasoning. Statistical investigative questions are perhaps the most important because they are challenging to learn and are the types of questions that determine whether an analysis is productive or not. Statistical investigative questions are questions that address variability and are productive in that they motivate data collection, analysis, and interpretation. The Data Collection phase might consist of collecting data through Participatory Sensing or some other means, or it might consist of examining previously collected data to determine the quality of the data for answering the statistical investigative questions. Data Analysis is almost always done on the computer and consists of creating relevant graphics and numerical summaries of the data. Data Interpretation is involved with using the analysis to answer the statistical investigative questions.","title":"Essential Concepts:"},{"location":"unit1/lesson4/#lesson","text":"During the past few lessons, we have discussed what data are, how to collect and organize them, and how their values can vary. But what do we do with all this data? How can we navigate it and turn it into something useful to us? Inform students that they will be learning about the Data Cycle today. The Data Cycle is a guide we can use when learning to think about data. We usually start with posing statistical investigative questions. Display the graphic from The Data Cycle file ( LMR_1.3 ): LMR_1.3 Display the Data Cycle on the board or on a projector, and give a brief explanation of the 4 components (listed below). Note: we will explore each component of the Data Cycle more explicitly throughout the course. Pose Statistical Investigative Questions: Statistical investigative questions are questions that address variability and can be answered with data. Consider Data: This is the process of observing and recording data, or of examining previously collected data to make sure it meets the needs of the investigation. Analyze Data: During analysis, tables, graphs, and summaries of the data are produced to help us find patterns and relationships. Interpret Data: The statistical investigative questions are answered by referring to the tables, graphs, and summaries made in the Data Analysis phase. Almost all statistical investigations begin with statistical investigative questions. There are times when the questions may be given to us, so we might start at the data collection step, but this should ideally be our starting point. As an example, explain that you might ask a person \u201cHow old are you?\u201d Although this is a question, it is NOT a statistical investigative question because we are only asking one person so there is no variability in the data. The question \u201cHow old are you?\u201d is a survey question that you might ask if you were trying to answer the investigative question: \u201cHow old are the students in my school?\u201d We would need to collect data to answer the question and we would expect student\u2019s ages to vary. To help students get a firm understanding of the Data Cycle and how each component is connected, they will participate in a Four Corners strategy (see Instructional Strategies in Teacher Resources ). Write down the name of each stage of the Data Cycle on a sheet of paper and include the description of that particular stage (see step 3 for descriptions). Then tape each sheet on a different corner of your room. Explain to the students that you are going to display different artifacts from statistical investigations on the projector. For each artifact, they will move to the corner of the room they feel that artifact represents (posing a statistical investigative question, consider data, analyze data, interpret data). If you have limited space in your classroom or for students that cannot physically participate, you might consider printing LMR_1.4_Data Cycle Spinners . Students can participate by pointing to the spinner. Once students have chosen a corner of the room (stage of the Data Cycle) they will discuss the following with their classmates in that same corner: What part of the data cycle does the artifact represent (posing a statistical investigative question, consider data, analyze data, interpret data)? Why do we think that? What questions or wonderings do we have about the artifact? Allow each group time to discuss the questions and have one member from each team (corner) share the answers to the questions. This activity is not about having a correct answer. It is about having students begin to think critically about statistical artifacts that they are constantly consuming. Data are encountered through visualizations, reports from scientific studies, journalists\u2019 articles and websites. This activity is meant to begin to develop students' statistical habits of mind. Artifact 1: Spreadsheet of the CDC data Note: You can display this spreadsheet using RStudio by running the following commands: data(cdc) View(cdc) What part of the data cycle does the artifact represent (posing a statistical investigative question, consider data, analyze data, interpret data)? Why do we think that? Answers will vary. What questions or wonderings do we have about the artifact? Students should begin developing statistical habits of mind. They should be interrogating the data by asking questions such as: Who is the data about? What was the purpose of collecting the data? What was the survey question asked to collect the data? Artifact 2: Article headline People Who Order Coffee Black Are More Likely To Be Psychopaths What part of the data cycle does the artifact represent (posing a statistical investigative question, consider data, analyze data, interpret data)? Why do we think that? Answers will vary. What questions or wonderings do we have about the artifact? Students should be interrogating this headline with questions like: What type of study was this? Who funded the study? What was the purpose of the study? How was the variable measured? Artifact 3: Dude Map found at (open in new tab): https://qz.com/316906/the-dude-map-how-american-men-refer-to-their-bros/ What part of the data cycle does the artifact represent (posing a statistical investigative question, consider data, analyze data, interpret data)? Why do we think that? Answers will vary. What questions or wonderings do we have about the artifact? Students should be asking questions like: What was the purpose of this study? What variables were measured and how were they measured? Inform students that the Dude Map was created for the Quartz website by Nikhil Sonnad as a data visualization. He collected the data via Twitter. The graphic shows how common the terms: bro, buddy, dude, fella and pal are when referring to friends throughout the United States. Ask students to return to their seats, take out their DS journal and make a sketch of the Data Cycle making sure to include the names of the four stages (Pose statstical investigative question, consider data, analyze data, interpret data). Ask students to write Dude Map under the analyze data of their data cycle and the information about where the data came from (see #13) in the consider data part of their Data Cycle sketch. Have each team discuss a possible investigative question that could be answered using the Dude Map graphic. Have the reporter/recorder write the question on a sticky note and the resource manager bring it up to the board. Lead a class discussion around the investigative questions the student teams created, and as a class, choose one to write down as an example. Example: Where in the United States is the term dude more common to use when referring to a friend? Allow the teams to work together to answer the investigative question. Ask the reporter/recorder to share their team's interpretation. Have students write down the answer that resonated the most with them under the interpret part of the data cycle. Assign ONE of the pages from the Bros & Dudes Graphics handout ( LMR_1.5 ) to each team. There are 10 different versions of word pairings (10 combinations of 2 words chosen from the 5 options), so multiple teams will have the same graphic if there are more than 10 teams in a class. LMR_1.5 The goal of this activity is for each team to complete a full statistical investigation with the Bros & Dudes Graphics assigned to them. Tell the teams that they need to create a Data Cycle poster using their assigned graphic for the analyze stage. The cycle should be clearly labeled and have appropriate responses for each of the 4 components. For example, a team given the \u201cBro\u201d and \u201cBuddy\u201d graphics might come up with the following questions: Which region of the US is most likely to use the term \u201cBro\u201d when referring to a friend? Do the coastal areas prefer different terms than the Midwest? Is there a difference between northern states versus southern states?","title":"Lesson:"},{"location":"unit1/lesson4/#class-scribes","text":"One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.","title":"Class Scribes:"},{"location":"unit1/lesson4/#homework","text":"Students reformulate any investigative questions generated by their team about the Bros & Dudes Graphics that could not be answered so that they can be answered.","title":"Homework"},{"location":"unit1/lesson5/","text":"Lesson 5: So Many Questions Objective: Students will learn the features of a good statistical investigative question. Materials: Sticky notes Vocabulary: (statistical) investigative questions Essential Concepts: Essential Concepts: Statistical investigative questions typically begin with a vague general question, then develop into a precise question. The process of developing or creating a good investigative question is iterative and requires time and effort to get right. In her 2021 paper, What Makes a Good Statistical Question, Dr. Pip Arnold identified the following as features of a good investigative question: (1) The variable(s) of interest is/are clear (2) The group or population we are interested in is clear (3) The question can be answered with the data (4) The question asks about the whole group, not an individual (5) The intention is clear (e.g., summary, comparison, association, time series) (6) The question is one that is worth investigating, is interesting, and has a purpose Lesson: Entrance Slip (see Instructional Strategies in Teacher Resources ): Each student should submit a ticket that displays the 4 components of the Data Cycle. Inform students that they will learn about what makes a good investigative question. Ask them to recall the definition of an investigative question: Investigative questions are questions that address variability and can be answered with data. They are questions we ask of the data. A good way to determine this is to ask: Do we need to see the data to answer the question? Remind students of the two questions from the previous lesson, noting that one of the questions was an investigative question, and the other was not: How old are you? How old are the students in my school? In pairs, ask students to analyze each question using the definition of an investigative question and come to an agreement about which one is an investigative question. Using Agree/Disagree (see Instructional Strategies in Teacher Resources ), ask a pair of students for their results. Discuss why the first question IS NOT an investigative question ( there is only one possible value so there is no variability in the data ) and why the second question IS an investigative question ( not all students are the same age. The ages vary, so there is variability in the data ). Ask students to think of the data they collected about the stick figures (name, GPA, friends, sport, height, shoe). Inform them that the researchers used the following survey questions to collect the data: What is your name? What is your GPA? How many friends do you have? What sport do you play? How tall are you in inches? What type of shoe do you mostly wear? Survey questions are another example of a type of statistical question, but with a different purpose to investigative questions. Survey questions are questions we ask to get the data. Tell students that it is important to know exactly what survey questions were asked to collect the data before asking investigative questions. For example, we saw an image of a ball next to each stick figure but we don\u2019t know if that represents a sport they like to watch, their favorite sport, or a team they are on. In teams, ask students to create investigative questions that could be answered using the data collected about the stick figures. Introduce the sentence stem \u201cI wonder\u2026\u201d to help students get started. Have the Recorder/Reporter record the questions on post-its. Ask the teams to identify which variable(s) each question is investigating by having them circle the variable name(s) within their investigative questions. Have the Task Manager organize their group\u2019s investigative questions on the board, placing investigative questions that incorporate only one variable on the left-hand side of the board and investigative questions that incorporate two or more variables on the right-hand side. Note: This sorting activity will help students begin to distinguish between different types of investigative questions. Summary investigative questions are questions about a single variable. Comparison investigative questions compare a numerical variable across groups. Association investigative questions look for a relationship between paired numerical or paired categorical variables. As a class, begin the process of transforming some of the summary investigative questions so that they have all of the features of a good investigative question. Here is an example to get you started: Initial investigative question : I wonder who has the most friends? Feature Explanation The variable(s) of interest is/are clear Yes. The variable of interest is the number of friends. The group or population we are interested in is clear No. Teacher should ask: \u201cWho did the researchers want to learn about?\u201d These stick figures . The question can be answered with the data Yes. The researchers collected data on the number of friends. The question asks about the whole group, not an individual No. This question is about an individual stick figure. Teacher should ask: \u201cHow can we reword the question to include the whole group?\u201d How many friends do ... have? The intention is clear (e.g., summary, comparison, association) It is clear that this is a summary investigative question (single variable), specifically the number of friends. The question is one that is worth investigating, is interesting, and has a purpose For students, this might be something interesting. Reworded investigative question after going through the criteria: I wonder how many friends this group of stick figures have? As a class, apply the same process to a few of the comparison and association questions. Initial investigative question: I wonder if someone who plays a specific sport has more friends? Feature Explanation The variable(s) of interest is/are clear Yes. This seems to be a comparison investigative question comparing the number of friends within the sport played. The group or population we are interested in is clear No. Teacher should ask: \u201cWho did the researchers want to learn about?\u201d These stick figures . The question can be answered with the data Yes. The researchers collected data on the number of friends and the sport the stick figures played. The question asks about the whole group, not an individual No. The word someone gives the impression that we are interested in one observation. The intention is clear (e.g., summary, comparison, association) The intent is somewhat clear. This seems to be a comparison investigative question between the sport the stick figures played and the number of friends each stick figure had. Teacher should ask: \u201cWhat is the variable that is being compared? Which groups within the sport variable are you comparing (all groups, specific groups)?\u201d. The question is one that is worth investigating, is interesting, and has a purpose For students, this might be something interesting. Reworded investigative question after going through the criteria: I wonder if there is a difference in the typical number of friends the stick figures have based on the sport they play? I wonder if these stick figures who play soccer tend to have more friends that these stick figures who play tennis? Using the criteria of a good statistical investigative question, student teams will go back and modify their statistical investigative questions. Facilitators will ensure the team goes through the criteria for each investigative question. Task Managers will encourage everyone to contribute. Resource Managers will ensure all materials are easily accessible for recording and reporting. Recorders in each team will capture team members\u2019 responses while the teacher circulates the room to check for understanding. Ask the Reporters of selected teams to share their revised statistical investigative question(s). Students in the audience will listen to the presentations and provide feedback about each team\u2019s statistical investigative question(s). Be sure to discuss disagreements before moving on to different questions. Inform students that, in the next lesson, they will begin using the Data Cycle to learn about their food habits.

They will learn about data that is collected by a Participatory Sensing campaign, and also about privacy issues and photo ethics when collecting and sharing data. Materials: Students\u2019 own mobile devices (smartphone or tablet compatible with iOS or Android) Access to App Store or Google Play Store in student devices to download IDS UCLA app Login information (username and password) for each student\u2014 generated and ready for distribution prior to the lesson Food Habits Campaign guidelines ( LMR_U1_Campaign_Food Habits ) Vocabulary: Participatory Sensing campaign surveys images GPS ethics photo ethics Essential Concepts: Essential Concepts: In Participatory Sensing, we humans behave as if we are robot sensors, collecting data whenever a \"trigger\" event occurs. Our ability to learn about the patterns in our life through these data depends on our being reliable data collectors. Lesson: Become familiar with the Food Habits Campaign guidelines (shown at the end of this lesson), especially the big questions found under \u201c1. The Issues,\u201d to help guide students during the campaign (see Campaign Guidelines in Teacher Resources ). Distribute the usernames and passwords to student team leaders (make sure safeguards are in place so that only the owner of the username and password is able to see this information). Ask team leaders to distribute their team\u2019s information when you are ready to download the IDS UCLA app . Ask students to think about the Nutritional Facts labels from which they collected data in the previous lesson, and answer the following in their DS journals: What questions would you want answered about eating habits? What can you do to find out about your own eating habits? Ask students to refer back to their reactions and comments from Jamie Oliver\u2019s video and have them ponder the question: What are we really eating? Over the next 9 days, they will engage in a Participatory Sensing campaign in which they will act as human sensors to collect data about themselves. The data collected will be used to analyze their classmates\u2019 and their own snacking habits. For this unit, they will collect data about every snack they eat. Note: Students should NOT collect data for full meals like breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Data should only be collected for anything eaten in between meals, like fruit, chips, cookies, nuts, sodas, etc. Ask students why it makes sense to study snacks specifically. Brainstorm some questions that could be answered using the snack-only data that would be hard to answer if the data included meals as well. Inform students that they will be taking part in a specific data collection method know as Participatory Sensing via a mobile application. This application can gather data via surveys , images , and GPS tracking. For students who choose to share their location, their precise location will not appear on the shared IDS map. In the interest of protecting student privacy, our GPS is configured to show a generalized location tag, not a specific address. Make it clear to students that the reason they are collecting the data is to learn more about themselves and their classmates, NOT to provide data for an external data collection team. Students occasionally have the misconception that when they use the Participatory Sensing app, they are providing data to external researchers, such as UCLA. Inform students that they are now going to engage in their own first Participatory Sensing data collection experience, in which they will collect their own data using a smart device. Depending on the device, there are 3 different options available: Android. A native Android application called \u201c IDS UCLA \u201d is available from the Google Play Store. iOS (Apple devices) The mobile application called \u201c IDS UCLA \u201d is available from the iOS App Store. No mobile device - browser-based version. For students that do not have a mobile device (or an unsupported device, such as a Windows phone or Blackberry), a browser-based version to perform data collection is available at https://portal.idsucla.org Click on the Survey Taking icon on the page. Once students have downloaded the app or have found the website, ask team leaders to distribute the login information. Students will need to keep this information in a safe place for the entire duration of this course. Emphasize the importance of keeping their username and password confidential. When students receive their login information, they can log in to the app. If students have trouble with their logins, the teacher has the ability to reset a student\u2019s password. Once logged into the app or the browser-based version, students will see the Campaigns in which they will participate. They will then select the campaign by tapping the name of the campaign. If no campaigns are visible, ask them to tap the refresh option, located on the top right hand side of the screen. Using one of their nutrition facts cutouts or pictures, ask students to complete their first survey by going through the questions in the app. After every student has had the opportunity to complete at least one survey, ask students the meaning of the word ethics . For this course, they will need to understand photo ethics . They may NOT take pictures of any person\u2019s identifying features such as faces, hair, hands, tattoos, etc. For this campaign, they may only take pictures of their snacks and/or the nutrition facts labels. Note to teacher: Inspect students\u2019 data collection photos throughout the data collection period and before each data collection, monitoring to ensure that no inappropriate images are shared. If you believe a photo is inappropriate, please delete the data entry immediately. Setting reminders: The IDS UCLA app has a reminder feature to help students in their data collection journey.

Inform students that today they will be learning how to visualize their data. Show the Value of Data Visualization video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xekEXM0Vonc , which describes the importance of graphical representations of data. As they watch the video, students should respond to the following in their DS journals: What is data visualization? List one example of how visualization can be used to increase data comprehension. Have a whole class discussion regarding the video\u2019s last statement: \u201cYour message is only as good as your ability to share it.\u201d Ask students: What does this statement mean? What makes a good message in terms of data and visualizations? Have students take out their nutrition facts labels or pictures, and also their Food Habits Data Collection handout (from lesson 6 ). On poster paper, make the first quadrant of a coordinate plane. Leave the labels for the x-axis and y-axis blank for now (see step 10). Distribute 3 pieces of tape to each student. Make sure they fold each piece of tape to make two sticky sides. Have each student tape one sticky side to the back of each label and ask them to have the labels ready to tape onto the poster paper. As a class, ask students to select 2 numerical variables and 1 categorical variable from the Food Habits Data Collection handout whose data they would like to see in a visualization , which is a picture of the data. For example, students may vote to see a visualization of the following numerical variables: calories per serving, total fat per serving; categorical variable: salty_sweet Once students select the variables, inform them that they will be creating a plot with the nutrition facts labels for each of the variables they selected. Create a bargraph of the categorical variable chosen by the students. Begin by showing students how to clearly label the x-axis with the categories. For instance, if salty_sweet is the variable, ask students to identify the categories for that variable. Then mark the y-axis with the label frequency , which simply means the number of times an outcome occurs. Do not put tick-marks on the y-axis. The frequency will be measured by the number of labels plotted. Have students come up and place their nutrition fact label above the category that describes their snack. Have students stack their nutrition label so that is easy to calculate the frequency. Once all the labels have been placed, create bars with the appropriate height (frequency) for each category. Make sure to leave spaces between the bars, and that bars are the same width. Ask students to respond to the following questions in their DS journals: How many data points does this distribution have? Why? What information is this visualization telling us about [insert categorical variable name] in the snacks we consume? Use another piece of poster paper to create a distribution for the first numerical variable chosen by the students. Create a dotplot of the first numerical variable chosen by the students. Begin by showing students how to clearly label the x-axis. For instance, if calories per serving is the variable, ask students for the range of values for calories per serving and determine the minimum and maximum values for the data set. Clearly label the x-axis with adequate intervals and the variable\u2019s name. Then mark the y-axis with the label frequency , which simply means the number of times a value occurs. Do not put tick-marks on the y-axis. The frequency will be measured by the number of labels plotted. For each value in the data set, put a nutrition facts label above that value on the x-axis. When a value occurs more than once, stack the nutrition facts labels. For example, if there are three nutrition facts labels with 120 calories per serving in the data set, there will be three nutrition facts labels above the 120 mark on the x-axis. Once all the labels have been placed, ask students to observe the distribution of the data in the dotplot. Ask students to respond to the following questions in their DS journals: What are the minimum and the maximum values of the data set? Answers will vary by class. The range is the largest value minus the smallest value. It is one way of measuring the variability of a variable. What is the range, and why do you think this measures the variability? Answers will vary by class. The range measures variability because if the values of the variable are really different, the range will be a big number (because the max and min will be far apart); but if there is little variability, the range will be small. For example, if all of the values were the same, we would have no variability and the range would be 0 because the max and min would be the same number. How many data points does this distribution have? Why? Answers will vary by class. What is the amount of [insert variable name] that appears most often in a snack? Why? Answers will vary by class. What do you think the phrase distribution of the data set means? It shows us how values are distributed. We learn where there are many values, where there are only a few values, and where there are no values at all. What information is this distribution telling us about the [insert variable name] in the snacks we consume? Answers will vary. We see how the value of [variable name] varies. For example, we can see whether all foods have the same number of calories, or if they differ. A distribution tells us two things: the values of the variable and the frequency of the values. \"Frequency\" is just another way of saying \"the count.\" Why is this dotplot a picture of the distribution of [variable name]? Because the location of the labels on the x-axis tells us the values we saw, and the number of labels at that value tells us the frequency for that value. Review the students\u2019 responses in a class discussion. Ask students to put a check mark next to the answers that were validated, and to revise the answers that need to be corrected. Use another piece of poster paper to create a distribution for the second numerical variable chosen by the students. Repeat steps 14-16 with this variable. On the first visualization for the numerical variable, show students how to convert the nutrition facts labels into something more readable. Draw another horizontal like on the plot above the nutrition facts labels. Explain that we can represent each label with an item such as a dot sticker or a sticky note. Then, start with the minimum x-value on the plot and place the new sticker above the second horizontal axis. Do this for each nutrition facts label in the plot. Once all values have been represented, ask the students how this new plot IS or IS NOT better than the original. Explain that we can call this type of plot a dotplot since we\u2019re using dots to represent each observation. Distribute the Tangible Plot handout ( LMR_1.9 ). Each student should pick one of the 2 numerical variables plotted on the poster paper. Then, they should complete part 1 of the Tangible Plot handout before leaving class. They will complete part 2 of the handout for homework. LMR_1.9 Ask students to think about the statistical questions they came up with.

Using TPS, ask students to think about what they can do to increase their data collection. Inform students that today they will be learning about a distribution\u2019s typical value. Ask the class to brainstorm characteristics of the \"typical\" student. Does the typical 12th grader differ from the typical 9th grader? How so? They may say that everyone is different, and that there's no typical student. Keep pressing them to identify characteristics that are typical. The idea is to get them to recognize that there is variability, and yet we might still have an opinion about what is typical. For instance, not all students walk to school, but this might still be the typical experience. Give students 3 minutes to write down synonyms to the word \u201ctypical\u201d in their DS journals. After time is up, have the students share their responses and keep a record on the board. Some possible synonyms might be: normal, average, usual, standard, representative, regular, ordinary, natural, etc. Once students share their synonyms, ask students to think about which terms apply best to categorical variables and which terms apply best to numerical variables. Ask volunteers to share out their thoughts and give a brief explanation of why they categorized the term as either applying best to categorical variables or numerical variables. Create a T-chart on the board to keep track of their categories. Next, display the dotplot created by the class with their nutrition facts labels during the previous class (from lesson 8 ). Ask: what value might we consider to be the typical value of this distribution? Answers will vary by class. Common answers will be to identify the mode (the value with the most labels) or the value in the center. A common wrong answer will be to confuse the frequency with the value. For example, they will say the most typical number of calories was \"3\" because, perhaps, 100 calories occurred 3 times, and that was more often than any other value. Students may also identify \"clumps\u201d of data: \"it's somewhere between 110 and 120.\" That's ok, but probe them as to why they chose that chunk and not another. The point is to get them to see that chunk as being in the middle or center of the distribution. Hopefully, at least one student will choose a value close to the center of the distribution. If not, point to a value near the extreme and ask them if they think this is typical. Then move closer to the center until they agree on which values are typical. It is ok to be vague in the definition of typical for today\u2019s lesson. The discussion needs to be very teacher-driven. Some possible points of discussion might be: Clustering/clumps of data. Most of the observations are between and . Overall range of the data. Ask students to reconsider the typical number of sugar grams. What is the typical amount of sugar (in grams) in our snacks? For example, students may come up with the same answer for different reasons: \u201cThe typical amount of sugar grams is 10.\u201d The reasons may include the data points are half below and half above; it\u2019s the mode; it has plurality. Then, tie it back to the synonyms they provided. Ask: Which synonym are you using? In pairs, ask students to discuss the question: Which synonyms are associated with \u201ccenter\u201d? Is this concept of center useful for numerical or categorical variables? Center is useful for numerical variables. The center of the distribution often corresponds to our notion of \u2018typical value.\u2019 For example, the typical height of the students in our class might be centered around 5\u20195. Inform students that the value at the center of the distribution often matches up with our everyday notion of the typical value of a distribution. The middle observation is not always the typical value. Similarly, the middle person would not always be the center value. Defining the center of a distribution depends on many things, such as the placement of points in the distribution (known as the shape ) and how dense the distribution is at certain values (known as the spread ). Ask the students to write down the number of hours of sleep they got last night. They will be creating a dotplot of this data, so ask them: What do you think the typical value will be? What do you think the lowest value will be? What do you think the highest value will be? What do you think the shape of the distribution will look like? One-by-one, have them come up to the board (or poster paper) and put a dot above the correct value on the dotplot. After each student has placed a dot on the board, have a discussion about the distribution. Is the typical value similar to what they originally thought? The shape? The variability? Why or why not? Next, have the students write down the number of hours of sleep they hope to get this Saturday. How do they think this plot will differ from the first plot? Focus discussion on the shape, center, and spread of the distributions. Repeat steps 8-9 and discuss how this plot is similar and/or different than the first plot.

The Issue: People report being more and more stressed every day. This trend is extending beyond adults, it is also reported by children and teenagers. The amount of work for which people are responsible has been increasing. To understand what makes us feel stressed, some important questions to ask are: a) What factors affect my stress/chill level? b) Do different personality types have different things that make them happy/sad? c) Do you like to be alone or with people? d) Is your stress/chill level a function of the environment in which you are? 2. Objectives: Upon completing this campaign, students will have compared groups and gained an understanding of variability within and between groups. They will have learned how to conduct and use permutations to model variability, perform informal inference, and how to do simulations to make predictions. 3.

Students will understand that the 'typical' value is a value that can represent the entire group, even though we know that not all members of the group share the same value. Lesson 2: What Does Mean Mean? The center of a distribution is the 'typical' value. One way of measuring the center is with the mean, which finds the balancing point of the distribution. The mean gives us the typical value, but does not tell the whole story. We need a way to measure the variability to understand how observations might differ from the typical value. Lesson 3: Median In the Middle Another measure of center is the median, which can also be used to represent the typical value of a distribution. The median is preferred for skewed distributions or when there are outliers, because it better matches what we think of as 'typical.' Lesson 4: How Far Is It from Typical? MAD measures the variability in a sample of data - the larger the value, the greater the variability. More precisely, the MAD is the typical distance of observations from the mean. There are other measures of spread as well, notably the standard deviation and the interquartile range (IQR). Lesson 5: Human Boxplots A common statistical question is \u201cHow does this group compare to that group?\u201d This is a hard question to answer when the groups have lots of variability. One approach is to compare the centers, spreads, and shapes of the distributions. Boxplots are a useful way of comparing distributions from different groups when all of the distributions are unimodal (one hump). Lesson 6: Face Off Writing (and saying) precise comparisons between groups in which variability is present based on the (a) center, (b) spread, (c) shape, and (d) unusual outcomes help to make statements in context of the data. Actual comparison statements should use terms such as \"less than,\" \"about the same as,\" etc. Lesson 7: Plot Match Boxplots are an alternative visualization of histograms or dot plots. They capture most, but not all, of the features we can see in a dot plot or histogram. Lesson 8: How Likely Is It? Probability is an area about which we humans have poor intuition. Probability measures a long-run proportion: 50% chance means the event happens 50% of the time if you repeated it forever. When we don't repeat forever, we see variability. Lesson 9: Bias Detective In the short-term, actual outcomes of chance experiments vary from what is 'ideal.' An ideal die has equally likely outcomes. But that does not mean we will see exactly the same number of one dots, two dots, etc. Lesson 10: Marbles, Marbles\u2026 There are two ways of sampling data that model real-life sampling situations: with and without replacement. Larger samples tend to be closer to the \"true\" probability. Lesson 11: This AND/OR That What does \"A or B\" mean versus \"A and B\" mean? These are compound events and two-way tables can be used to calculate probabilities for them. Lesson 12: Don\u2019t Take My Stress Away! Generating statistical questions is the first step in a Participatory Sensing campaign. Research and observations help create applicable campaign questions. Lesson 13: The Horror Movie Shuffle We can \"shuffle\" data based on categorical variables. The statistic we use is the difference in proportions. The distribution we form by shuffling represents what happens if chance were the only factor at play. If the actual observed difference in proportions is near the center of this shuffling distribution, then we would conclude that chance is a good explanation for the difference. But if it is extreme (in the tails or off the charts), then we should conclude that chance is NOT to blame. Sometimes, the apparent difference between groups is caused by chance. Lesson 14: The Titanic Shuffle We can also \"shuffle\" data based on numerical variables. The statistic we use is the difference in means. The distribution we form by this form of shuffling still represents what happens if chance were the only factor at play. When differences are small, we suspect that they might be due to chance. When differences are big, we suspect they might be 'real.' Lesson 15: Tangible Data Merging We can enhance the context of a statistical problem by merging related data sets together. To merge data, each data set must have a \"unique identifier\" that tells us how to match up the lines of the data. Lesson 16: What Is Normal? The Normal curve, also called the Gaussian distribution and the \"bell curve,\" is a model that describes many real-life distributions and is usually called the Normal Model. Lesson 17: A Normal Measure of Spread The standard deviation is another measure of spread. This is commonly used by statisticians because of its role in common models and distributions, such as the Normal Model. Lesson 18: Shuffling with Normal Z-scores allow us a way to measure how extreme a value is, regardless of the units of measurement. Usually, z-scores will range between -3 and +3, and so values that are at or more extreme than -3 or +3 standard deviations are considered large.","title":"Essential Concepts"},{"location":"unit2/essential/#ids-unit-2-essential-concepts","text":"","title":"IDS Unit 2: Essential Concepts"},{"location":"unit2/essential/#lesson-1-what-is-your-true-color","text":"Students will understand that the 'typical' value is a value that can represent the entire group, even though we know that not all members of the group share the same value.","title":"Lesson 1: What Is Your True Color?"},{"location":"unit2/essential/#lesson-2-what-does-mean-mean","text":"The center of a distribution is the 'typical' value.

In the beginning... Most of the labs thus far have covered how to visualize, summarize, and manipulate data. \u2013 We used visualizations to explore how your class spends their time. \u2013 We also learned how to clean data to prepare it for analyzing. Starting with this lab, we'll learn to use R to answer statistical questions that can be answered by calculating the mean, median and MAD. How to talk about data When we make plots of our data, we usually want to know: Where is the bulk of the data? Where is the data more sparse , or thin ? What values are typical ? How much does the data vary ? To answer these questions, we want to look at the distribution of our data. \u2013 We describe distributions by talking about where the center of the data are, how spread out the data are, and what sort of shape the data has. Let's begin! Export , upload and import your class' Personality Color data. \u2013 Name your data colors when you load it. Before analyzing a new data set, it's often helpful to get familiar with it. So: \u2013 Write down the names of the 4 variables that contain the point-totals, or scores , for each personality color. \u2013 Write down the names of the variables that tell us an observation's introvert/extrovert designation and whether they are involved in sports . \u2013 How many variables are in the data set? \u2013 How many observations are in the data set? Estimating centers Create a dotPlot of the scores for your predominant color . \u2013 Pro-tip: If the dotPlot comes out looking wonky, include the nint and cex options. Based on your dotPlot : \u2013 Which values came up the most frequently? About how many people in your class had a score similar to yours? \u2013 What, would you say, was a typical score for a person in your class for your predominant color? How does your own score for this color compare? Means and medians Means and medians are usually good ways to describe the typical value of our data. Fill in the blank to calculate the mean value of your predominant color score: mean(~____, data = colors) Use a similar line of code to calculate the median value of your predominant color. \u2013 Are the mean and median roughly the same? If not, use the dotPlot you made in the last slide to describe why. Estimating Spread Now that we know how to describe our data's typical value we might also like to describe how closely the rest of the data are to this typical value. \u2013 We often refer to this as the variability of the data. \u2013 Variability is seen in a histogram or dotPlot as the horizontal spread . Re-create a dotPlot of the scores for your predominant color and then run the code below filling in the blank with the name of your predominant color: add_line(vline = mean(~____, data = colors)) Look at the spread of the scores from the mean score then complete the sentence below: Data points in my plot will usually fall within units of the center. Mean Absolute Deviation The mean absolute deviation finds how far away, on average, the data are from the mean. \u2013 We often write mean absolute deviation as MAD. Calculate the MAD of your predominant color by filling in the blanks: MAD(~_____, data = colors) How close was your estimate of the spread for your predominant color (from the previous slide) to the actual value?

Directions: Follow along with the slides, completing the questions in blue on your computer, and answering the questions in red in your journal. Just the beginning Means, medians,and MAD are just a few examples of numerical summaries . In this lab, we will learn how to calculate and interpret additional summaries of distributions such as: minimums, maximums, ranges, quartiles and IQRs. \u2013 We'll also learn how to write our first custom function! Start by loading your Personality Color data again and name it colors . Extreme values Besides looking at typical values, sometimes we want to see extreme values, like the smallest and largest values. \u2013 To find these values, we can use the min , max or range functions. These functions use a similar syntax as the mean function. Find and write down the min value and max value for your predominant color. Apply the range function to your predominant color and describe the output. \u2013 The range of a variable is the difference between a variable\u2019s smallest and largest value. \u2013 Notice, however, that our range function calculates the maximum and minimum values for a variable, but not the difference between them. \u2013 Later in this lab you will create a custom Range function that will calculate the difference. Quartiles (Q1 & Q3) The median of our data is the value that splits our data in half. \u2013 Half of our data is smaller than the median , half is larger. Q1 and Q3 are similar. \u2013 25% of our data are smaller than Q1 , 75% are larger. - 75% of our data are smaller than Q3 , 25% are larger. Fill in the blanks to compute the value of Q1 for your predominant color. quantile(~____, data = ____, p = 0.25) Use a similar line of code to calculate Q3 , which is the value that's larger than 75% of our data. The Inter-Quartile-Range (IQR) Make a dotPlot of your predominant color's scores. Make sure to include the nint option. Visually (Don't worry about being super-precise): \u2013 Cut the distribution into quarters so the number of data points is equal for each piece. (Each piece should contain 25% of the data.) Hint: You might consider using the add_line(vline = ) to add vertical lines at the quarter marks. \u2013 Write down the numbers that split the data up into these 4 pieces. \u2013 How long is the interval of the middle two pieces? \u2013 This length is the IQR . Calculating the IQR The IQR is another way to describe spread . \u2013 It describes how wide or narrow the middle 50% of our data are. Just like we used the min and max to compute the range , we can also use the 1st and 3rd quartiles to compute the IQR . Use the values of Q1 and Q3 you calculated previously and find the IQR by hand. \u2013 Then use the iqr() function to calculate it for you. Which personality color score has the widest spread according to the IQR ? Which is narrowest? Boxplots By using the medians, quartiles, and min/max, we can construct a new single variable plot called the box and whisker plot, often shortened to just boxplot . By showing someone a dotPlot , how would you teach them to make a boxplot ? Write out your explanation in a series of steps for the person to use. \u2013 Use the steps you write to create a sketch of a boxplot for your predominant color's scores in your journal. \u2013 Then use the bwplot function to create a boxplot using R . Our favorite summaries In the past two labs, we've learned how to calculate numerous numerical summaries . \u2013 Computing lots of different summaries can be tedious. Fill in the blanks below to compute some of our favorite summaries for your predominant color all at once. favstats(~____, data=colors) Calculating a range value We saw in the previous slide that the range function calculates the maximum and minimum values for a variable, but not the difference between them. We could calculate this difference in two steps: \u2013 Step 1: Use the range function to assign the max and min values of a variable the name values . This will store the output from the range function in the environment pane. values <- range(~____, data=colors) \u2013 Step 2: Use the diff function to calculate the difference of values . The input for the diff function needs to be a vector containig two numeric values. diff(values) Use these two steps to calculate the range of your predominant color. Introducing custom functions Calculating the range of many variables can be tedious if we have to keep performing the same two steps over and over. \u2013 We can combine these two steps into one by writing our own custom function . Custom functions can be used to combine a task that would normally take many steps to compute and simplify them into one. The next slide shows an example of how we can create a custom function called mm_diff to calculate the absolute difference between the mean and median value of a variable in our data . Example function mm_diff <- function(variable, data) { mean_val <- mean(variable, data = data) med_val <- median(variable, data = data) abs(mean_val - med_val) } The function takes two generic arguments: variable and data It then follows the steps between the curly braces { } \u2013 Each of the generic arguments is used inside the mean and median functions. Copy and paste the code above into an R script and run it. The mm_diff function will appear in your Environment pane. Using mm_diff() After running the code used to create the function, we can use it just like we would any other numerical summary. \u2013 In the console , fill in the blanks below to calculate the absolute difference between the mean and median values of your predominant color: ____(~____, data = ____) Which of the four colors has the largest absolute difference between the mean and median values? \u2013 By examining a dotPlot for this personality color, make an argument why either the mean or median would be the better description of the center of the data. Our first function Using the previous example as a guide, create a function called Range ( Note the capial 'R' ) that calculates the range of a variable by filling in the blanks below: ____ <- function (____, ____) { values <- range(____, data = ____) diff(___) } Use the Range function to find the personality color with the largest difference between the max and min values.

A new direction For the past two labs, we've looked at ways that we can summarize data with numbers. \u2013 Specifically, you learned how to describe the center , shape and spread of variables in our data. In this lab, we're going to estimate the probability that a rap song will be chosen from a playlist with both rap and rock songs, if the choice is made at random. \u2013 The playlist we'll work with has 100 songs: 39 are rap and 61 are rock. Estimate what ... ? To estimate the probability , we're going to imagine that we select a song at random, write down its genre ( rock or rap ), put the song back in the playlist, and repeat 499 more times for a total of 500 times. The statistical question we want to address is: On average, what proportion of our selections will be rap? Why do we put a song back each time we make a selection? What would happen in our little experiment if we did not do this? Calculating probabilities Remember that a probability is the long-run proportion of time an event occurs. \u2013 Many probabilities can be answered exactly with just a little math. \u2013 The probability we draw a single rap song from our playlist of 39 rap and 61 rock songs is 39/100 , 0.39 or 39% . Probabilities can also be answered exactly if we were willing to randomly select a song from the playlist, write down its genre , place the song back in the list, and repeatedly do this forever . \u2013 Literally, forever ... \u2013 But we don't have that much time. So we're only going to do it 500 times which will give us an estimate of the probability . Estimating probabilities You might ask, Why are we estimating the probability if we know the answer is 39%? \u2013 Sometimes, probabilities are too hard to calculate with simple division as we did above. In which case, we can often program a computer to run an experiment to estimate the probability. \u2013 We refer to these programs as simulations . The techniques you learn in this lab could be applied to very simple probability calculations or very hard and complex calculations. \u2013 In both cases, your estimated probability would be very close to the actual probability. Getting ready Simulations are meant to mimic what happens in real-life using randomness and computers. \u2013 Before we can start simulating picking songs from a playlist, we need to simulate that playlist in R . Simulate our 39 rap songs using the repeat rep() function. rap <- rep(\"rap\", times = 39) Look in the Environment pane for the vector containing your rap songs. Use a similar line of code to simulate the rock songs in our playlist of 100. Put the songs in the playlist Now that we've got some different songs, we need to combine them together. \u2013 To do this, we can use the combine function c() in R . Fill in the blanks to combine your different songs: songs <- __(rap, ____) And with that, our playlist of songs should be ready to go. \u2013 Type songs into the console and hit enter to see your individual songs . Pick a song, any song Data scientists call the act of choosing things randomly from a set, sampling . \u2013 We can randomly choose a song from our playlist by using: sample(songs, size = 1, replace = TRUE) Run this code 10 times and compute the proportion of \"rap\" songs you drew from the 10. Vocabulary Check: A proportion is a fraction of the whole. For example, if 2 rap songs were drawn from the 10, the proportion would be 2/10 It is more common to express a proportion as a decimal, in this case, 0.20 It is even more common to express a proportion as a percentage, 20% Once everyone in your class has computed their proportions , calculate the range of proportions (the largest proportion minus the smallest proportion ) for your class and write it down. Now do() it some more Instead of running the same line of code multiple times ourselves we can use R to do() multiple repetitions for us. \u2013 Fill in the blanks below to do the sample code from the previous slide 50 times: do(___) * sample(___, ___ = ___, ___ = ___) Recall that we need to store our results to be able to perform analysis. Assign the 50 selected songs the name draws and then View your file. What is the variable name? R defaulted to naming the variable based on the function used. You may use the data cleaning skills you learned in lab 6 to rename the variable if you wish. Fill in the blank below to tally how often each genre was selected: tally(~___, data = draws) Compute the proportion of \"rap\" songs for your 50 draws and find out if the range for your class' proportions is bigger or smaller than when we drew 10 songs. Proportions vs. Probability To review, so far in this lab we've: \u2013 Simulated a \"playlist\" of songs. \u2013 Repeatedly simulated drawing a song from the playlist, noting its genre and placing it back in the playlist. \u2013 Computed the proportion of the draws that were \"rap\" . These proportions are all estimates of the theoretical probability of choosing a rap song from a playlist. \u2013 As we increase the number of draws, the range of proportions should shrink. When using simulations to estimate probabilities, using a large number of repeats is better because the estimates have less variability and so we can be confident we're closer to the actual value. Non-random Randomness We've seen that random simulations can produce many different outcomes. \u2013 Some estimated probabilities in your class were smaller/larger relative to others. There are instances where you might like the same random events to occur for everyone. \u2013 We can do this by using set.seed() . For example, the output of this code will always be the same: set.seed(123) sample(songs, size = 1, replace = TRUE) ## [1] \"rap\" Playing with seeds With a partner, choose a number to include in set.seed then redo the simulation of 50 songs. \u2013 Both partners should run set.seed(___) just before simulating the 50 draws. \u2013 The blank in set.seed(___) should be the same number for both partners. \u2013 Verify that both partners compute the same proportion of \"rap\" songs. Redo the 50 simulations one last time but have each partner choose a different number for set.seed(___) . \u2013 Are the proportions still the same? If so, can you find two different values for set.seed that give different answers? On your own Suppose there are 1,200 students at your school. 400 of them went to the movies last Friday, 600 went to the park and the rest read at home. If we select a student at random, what is the probability that this student is one of the one's who went to the movies last Friday? Answer this by estimating the probability that a randomly chosen student went to the movies using 500 simulations. \u2013 Write down both the estimated probability and the code you used to compute your estimate. You might find it helpful to write your answer in an R Script (File -> New File -> R Script) \u2013 Include set.seed(123) in your code before you do 500 repeated samples.","title":"Lab 2C - Which Song Plays Next?"},{"location":"unit2/lab2c/#lab-2c-which-song-plays-next","text":"Directions: Follow along with the slides, completing the questions in blue on your computer, and answering the questions in red in your journal.","title":"Lab 2C - Which Song Plays Next?"},{"location":"unit2/lab2c/#a-new-direction","text":"For the past two labs, we've looked at ways that we can summarize data with numbers. \u2013 Specifically, you learned how to describe the center , shape and spread of variables in our data.

Directions: Follow along with the slides, completing the questions in blue on your computer, and answering the questions in red in your journal. Where we left off In the last lab, we looked at how we can use computer simulations to compute estimates of simple probabilities. \u2013 Like the probability of drawing a song genre from a playlist. We also saw that performing more simulations: \u2013 Took longer to finish. \u2013 Had estimates that varied less . In this lab, we'll extend our simulation methods to cover situations that are more complex. \u2013 We'll learn how to estimate their probabilities. \u2013 We also look at the roll of sampling with or without replacement . Back to songs In R , simulate a playlist of songs containing 30 \"rap\" songs, 23 \"country\" songs and 47 \"rock\" songs. \u2013 Assign the combined playlist the name songs . Simulate choosing a single song 50 times. Then use your simulated draws to estimate the probability of choosing a rap song. \u2013 The actual (theoretical) probability of choosing a rap song in this case is 0.30 . \u2013 Write a sentence comparing your estimated probability to the actual probability. With or Without? So far, you've selected songs with replacement . \u2013 We called it that, because each time you made a selection, you started with the same playlist. That is, you chose a song, wrote down its data, and then placed it back on the list. It's also possible to select without replacement by setting the replace option in the sample function to FALSE . Take a sample of size 100 from our playlist of songs without replacement . Assign this sample the name without . \u2013 Run tally(without) and describe the output. Does something similar happen if you sample with replacement ? Notice that the tilde ~ was not needed with the tally function. This is because without was not a variable within a data frame but rather a vector which acts like a lone variable. \u2013 What happens if size = 101 and replace = FALSE ? Sample with? Or without? Imagine the following two scenarios. `1. You have a coin with two sides: Heads and Tails . You're not sure if the coin is fair and so you want to estimate the probability of getting a Head . `2. A child reaches into a candy jar with 10 strawberry , 50 chocolate and 25 watermelon candies. The child is able to grab three candies with their hand and you're interested in probability that all three candies will be chocolate. Which of these scenarios would you sample with replacement and which would you sample without replacement ? Why? \u2013 Write down the line of code you would run to sample from the candy jar. Assume the simulated jar is named candies . Simulations at work In reality, songs from a playlist are chosen without replacement. \u2013 This way, you won't hear the same song several times in a row. Let's write a more realistic simulation and estimate the probability that if we select two songs at random, without replacement, that both are rap songs. \u2013 Use the do function to perform 10 simulated sample s of size 2, without replacement and assign the simulations the name draws and then View your file. Use set.seed(1) . What are the variable names? What happened in the first simulation? Did any of your 10 simulations contain two rap songs? Simulations and probability To estimate the probability from our simulations, we need to find the proportion of times that the event we're interested in occurs in the simulations. In other words, we need to count the number of times the desired events occurred, divided by the number of attempts we made (the number of simulations). The next slides will show you two ways to do this. Counting similar outcomes One way we can estimate the probability of drawing two songs of the same genre is to use the following trick to count the number of rap songs in each of the 10 simulations: mutate(draws, nrap = rowSums(draws==\"rap\")) Let\u2019s break down the code above by running each part of the code one piece at a time. As you run each line of code below describe the output. draws == \"rap\" rowSums(draws == \"rap\") mutate(draws, nrap = rowSums(draws==\"rap\")) Remember to assign a name to your mutated data set. Counting other outcomes Another method we can use to estimate the probability of complex events is to use the following 2-step procedure: `1. Subset or filter the rows of the simulations that match our desired outcomes. `2. Count the number of rows in the subset and divide by the number of simulations. The result that you obtain is an estimate of the probability that a specific combination of events occurred. We'll see an example of this method on the next slide. Step 1: Creating a subset Fill in the blanks below to: `1. Create a subset of our simulations when both draws were \"rap\" songs. `2. Count the number of rows in this subset `3. And divide by the total number of repeated simulations. draws_sub <- filter(draws, ___ == \"rap\", ___ == \"rap\") nrow(___) / ___ Estimating probabilities Answer the following questions by performing 500 simulations of sampling 2 songs from a playlist of 30 rap, 23 country and 47 rock songs. You might consider running set.seed so that your results can be reproduced: Calculate estimated probabilities for the following situations: `1. You draw two \"rap\" songs. `2. You draw a \"rap\" song in the first draw and a \"country\" song in the 2nd. Create a histogram that displays the number of times a \"rap\" song occurred in each simulation.

Playing with permutations Slasher films are notoriously gory and are said to contain recurring biases. \u2013 One such bias, is that women in slasher films are more likely to survive than men. This lab will focus on the statistical question: Are women in slasher films more likely to survive until the end of the film than men? To answer this question, we'll learn how to use permuted data to gauge how likely an event occurs by chance. To begin, use the data function to load the slasher data file. \u2013 The data contains information about 485 characters from a random sample of 50 slasher horror films. Initial thoughts... To familiarize yourself with the data, answer the following: \u2013 How many variables and observations are contained in the data and what are the possible values of the variables? \u2013 Which gender had more survivors? Write down a few sentences as to how you came to your conclusion. Be sure to look at both the counts and percentages of survivors in each group before deciding. \u2013 Calculate the difference between the percentage of females who survived and the percentage of males who survived. Is the difference large enough to conclude that women tend to survive more often than men? Tally whoa ... ! Something you might have noticed is that these two lines of code aren't equivalent: tally(~gender | survival, data = slasher, margin = TRUE) tally(~survival | gender, data = slasher, margin = TRUE) The first line of code takes the group of survivors and tells us how many of them were Male or Female . The other takes the group of females / males and tells us how many of them Dies or Survives . The last question on the previous slide can be answered using the line of code below. Why? Pro-tip: Include the option format = \"percent\" to obtain a two-way table with percentages. tally(~survival | gender, format = \"percent\", data = slasher, margin = TRUE) ## gender ## survival Female Male ## Dies 77.47748 86.69202 ## Survives 22.52252 13.30798 ## Total 100.00000 100.00000 Examining differences When we're comparing the difference between two quantities, such as survival rates of slasher films, it can be difficult to decide how different two values need to be before we can conclude that the difference didn't just happen by chance. \u2013 To help us decide when a difference is not due to chance, we'll use repeated random shuffling. By using repeated random shuffling, we'll estimate how often our actual difference occurs by chance . Do the shuffle! When we shuffle data, we use our original data set as a starting point. \u2013 Run the following and write down the resulting table on a piece of paper. tally(~survival | gender, data = slasher) Now run the following to randomly reassign each survival status to each observation. Compare the resulting table to the one you wrote down. tally(~shuffle(survival) | gender, data = slasher) Let's compare ... How many people, in total, survived the slasher film before shuffling? How many people survived after shuffling? How has shuffling our data changed the percentage of women who survived compared to men who survived? \u2013 Is the difference in percentages from your shuffled data larger or smaller than the difference from the original data? Interpret what this means. Explain why shuffling our data one time is not enough to decide if the difference seen in our actual data occurs by chance or not. Detecting differences To help us decide if the difference in percentages in our actual data occurs by chance or not, we can use the do() function to shuffle our data many times and see how often our actual difference occurred by chance. **Run the following lines of code: set.seed(7) shuffled_outcomes <- do(10) * tally(~shuffle(survival) | gender, format = \"percent\", data = slasher) View(shuffled_outcomes) In how many simulations did a higher percentage of males survive than females? What is the largest difference in percentages of survival between males and females? What patterns are emerging from these simulations? Ten simulations is not enough. Use the code above and perform 500 shuffles. Assign your 500 shuffles the same name shuffled_outcomes . Use set.seed(1) . Now what? The next step to find out how often our actual difference occurs by chance is to compare it to the differences in our shuffled data. To compute the differences for each shuffle we can use the mutate function. \u2013 Fill in the blanks to add a new column that contains the difference between Survives.Female and Survives.Male to our shuffled_outcomes data. shuffled_outcomes <- mutate(shuffled_outcomes, diff = ____ - ____) Time to decide Create a histogram of the difference s in our shuffled_outcomes data. Based on your plot, answer the following: \u2013 What was the typical difference in percentages between men and women survivors?

Objective: Students will collect data that might tell them about their personality type, and will understand how to subset their data. Materials: True Colors Personality Test ( LMR_2.1_True Colors Personality Test ) Posted signs for each Personality Color: Blue, Gold, Green, and Orange Advanced preparation required (see step 5 below) Poster paper Markers Data collection devices Vocabulary: subsets Essential Concepts: Essential Concepts: Students will understand that the 'typical' value is a value that can represent the entire group, even though we know that not all members of the group share the same value. Lesson: Ask students to consider the following questions (they do not need to record any responses): How well do you know yourself? How well do you know your classmates? There are things students know and don\u2019t know about themselves. The True Colors Personality Test ( LMR_2.1 ) claims to identify personality types (Later, students can gather more evidence to test these claims). Students will use these data to explore fundamental statistical concepts. LMR_2.1 Distribute the first 2 pages of the True Colors Personality Test ( LMR_2.1 ). DO NOT include the final page, which contains the descriptions of each color. Instruct students on how to complete the test, and allow time for them to complete it (see page 2 in handout). Note: When adding scores for each color at the bottom of the test, make sure that students have NOT added straight down each column. Students should have a score for each of the 4 colors. Ask students to record each color and its respective score in their DS journal. Inform them that the color with the highest score describes their personality. We can refer to this as their predominant color. They should record their predominant personality color in their DS journal as well. Tell students that you will show them what each color means at the end of the lesson. Post a sign for each personality color on different walls of the classroom. For example, Blue on the north wall, Gold on the east wall, etc. Ask students to gather by the wall corresponding to their predominant personality color. The students should record answers to the following questions in their DS journals. How many students are in your color group? How many students are in each of the other color groups? What is the predominant personality color in your class? Then ask students to determine some common characteristics of the people in their group. Questions to help steer the discussions are included below. Each team should come up with a consensus to describe their team and will share their descriptions with the whole class. The goal is to get the students to think about \u201cwhat is typical?\u201d within their groups. What are your likes and dislikes? What things do you have in common? What are your favorite activities? What\u2019s your favorite color? Do you prefer mornings or nights? What\u2019s your favorite type of music? As the groups are presenting, record some dominant characteristics on the board for each color. The students will be able to compare their perceived traits with the actual descriptions from the activity at the end of the class. Next ask students in each color group to gather into two subsets : introvert and extrovert. Inform them that subsetting is another way to organize collected data. Create a two-way frequency table like the one below on the board to record the results. Distribute poster paper and markers to each team. Inform the students that they will be creating visuals for this data by comparing subsets. The Orange and Gold groups should create visualizations that subset the color variable by introverts and extroverts, and the Blue and Green groups should create visualizations that subset introverts and extroverts by color. If students are confused or stuck, have them recall the topic of two-way tables and relative frequencies from Unit 1 ( Lessons 16 & 17 ). The Orange and Gold groups will be looking at the columns and comparing introverts/extroverts, while the Blue and Green groups will be looking at the rows and comparing colors. Once all groups have completed their visuals, the Orange and Gold teams should choose one of their 2 posters to display to the class. The Blue and Green groups should do the same and select one of their visuals. Display both visuals on the board and discuss their similarities and differences. Ask students to analyze and interpret the visualizations by discussing the following questions for each of the visualizations: What type of plot is this and how many variables are present? Answers will vary by class. What information about this subset can I gather from this visualization? Answers will vary by class. What do I see the most/least of? Answers will vary by class. What is the typical personality color for this subset? Or, what is the typical group(introverts/extroverts) for this subset? Answers will vary by class. Ask students to summarize their impressions of the class\u2019s personality color data by writing this summary in their DS journals. Distribute the description of each personality color to students (page 3 of LMR_2.1 ). Remind them that the highest score is considered their predominant color and the second highest score is considered their secondary color. If there is a tie for their predominant or secondary colors, ask students to choose the color that describes their personality better. Compare the given descriptions on the handout to the characteristics listed on the board for each group during step 7. Do the descriptions match what the students originally thought?

Objective: Students will understand that random events vary, so that the percentage predicted by a probability isn't exact, but varies. Students practice converting percentages to proportions. Materials: For each student team: 50 marbles \u2013 20 of one color, and 30 of another color Note: Marbles can be substituted for other materials, such as small blocks, as long as they are the same size. Vocabulary: proportion percentage event with replacement without replacement Essential Concepts: Essential Concepts: There are two ways of sampling data that model real-life sampling situations: with and without replacement. Larger samples tend to be closer to the \"true\" probability. Lesson: Remind students that, during the previous two lessons, they learned how to estimate probabilities for a population with the help of simulations to create sample data. Both lessons had nice, prepackaged functions already available in RStudio, which made the simulations fairly quick and easy \u2013 in Lesson 8 , the rflip() function was used to simulate flipping a coin; and in Lesson 9 , the roll_die() function was used to simulate rolling one of two dice. But what if we don\u2019t have a nice function to perform a simulation for us? Can we create our own method? Yes! We will actually learn to create a simulation from scratch during Lab 2C . Ask students: If you have a bag of 50 marbles, where 20 of them are blue and 30 of them are red, what is the probability of drawing a red marble? 30/50 or 60%. Select a student to answer the question. Ask the class if they agree or disagree. If they agree, ask them to raise their hand. If there are students who disagree, lead a class discussion until a consensus is reached. Ask students to share their strategies on how to convert the proportion into a percentage . As strategies are being shared, students should take notes in their IDS journals. Review how to turn fractions into percentages, if necessary. Ask students: What if we actually drew out one marble, recorded its color, then replaced it back in the bag, and did this 10 times? Answers will vary by class. Would the percentage of red marbles in this sample necessarily be exactly the same as the probability? Identify that each time a marble is drawn, we are creating an event . Answers will vary by class. Distribute the bags of marbles to each team. Ask each team to: Shake the bag of marbles. Draw one marble out of the bag. Record the marble\u2019s color in their IDS journal. Replace the marble back into the bag. Inform them that this is called sampling with replacement . Ask them to consider what \u201cwith replacement\u201d means and discuss with the class. \u201cWith replacement\u201d means that after you select a marble from the bag, you have to put it back into the bag (replace it) before you select another marble. They should draw 10 marbles from the bag and record the observed colors. Do a Whip Around to find out how many times each team drew a red marble out of their 10 draws. Have them calculate the corresponding sample proportions. For example, if one team drew 7 red marbles out of their 10 draws, their sample proportion is 7/10 = 0.70 (which is the sample as a sample percentage of 70%). Ask students why the proportions are perhaps different from each other and from the \u201ctrue\u201d probability of drawing a red marble? Have the student teams continue drawing marbles, one at a time and with replacement, until they have 50 events recorded. Discuss the following questions: How many times did they draw a red marble out of these 50? Answers will vary by class. What\u2019s the corresponding sample proportion? Is it closer to the true probability than when you only drew 10 marbles? Answers will vary by class. But, they should notice that, as the sample size increases, the sample proportion gets closer to the true population proportion. Engage students in a discussion about how the sample size affects the sample proportion. They should see that as they draw more marbles, their sample probability gets closer and closer to the true probability. If we were to continue drawing marbles forever, in the long run, our sample proportion should equal our true probability. Have students consider what it might mean to sample without replacement . How would they do that with their bag of marbles? \u201cWithout replacement\u201d means that after you select a marble from the bag, you never put it back into the bag (do not replace it). Instead, you simply select another marble from the bag immediately. Students should recognize that, by not replacing the marble each time, the probabilities will change. This means each draw from the marble bag is NOT independent from another draw because removing one marble impacts the next event. Exit Slip : Based on this lesson, ask students to describe a sample, an event, and replacement.

Materials: Compound Probabilities handout ( LMR_2.13_Compound Probabilities ) Blue sticky notes Gold sticky notes Four signs on the board labeled: Pickles, Mayonnaise, Both, None (in that exact order, and equally spaced across the length of the board) Vocabulary: compound probabilities Essential Concepts: Essential Concepts: What does \"A or B\" mean versus \"A and B\" mean? These are compound events and two-way tables can be used to calculate probabilities for them. Lesson: Remind the students that they have been learning about estimating probabilities of single events based on sample proportions. Inform them that, today, they will learn how to calculate proportions when multiple events happen. Review the basic idea of computing probabilities; in other words, the number of outcomes we are interested in divided by the total number of outcomes possible. Pose the questions below to the class. Note: They do not need to come up with specific answers; this is a time for them to make suggestions. How would we compute the probability of two outcomes occurring at the same time? For example, what is the probability that a randomly chosen student likes both pickles AND mayonnaise? How would we compute the probability of either of two outcomes occurring? For example, what is the probability that a randomly chosen student likes either pickles OR mayonnaise? For both questions, steer the students towards using the definition from Step 2. That is, we want the students to realize that they can count the number of people that qualify for the given circumstance and divide by the total number of people to calculate a probability. In order to define AND/OR probabilities, students will participate in an activity where they are grouped by their food preferences. Divide the board into 4 groups and write the words \u201cPickles,\u201d \u201cBoth,\u201d \u201cMayonnaise,\u201d and \u201cNone,\u201d in that order, from left to right. Ask for 10 volunteers to stand by the word that represents their preferences. That is, if they only like pickles, they should stand by the word \u201cPickles.\u201d If they like both pickles and mayonnaise, they should stand by the word \u201cBoth.\u201d Note: If all 4 groups do not have at least one student in them, select a few more students to stand at the board. Ask the remaining students (those still seated) to count the total number of people standing by the board and have a student volunteer share the answer with the class. Answers will vary by class. Next, create a 2-way frequency table like the one below to organize the values of student preferences as follows: Counts for students who like both go in the Yes/Like Mayonnaise and Yes/Like Pickles box. Counts for students who like none go in the No/Like Mayonnaise and No/Like Pickles box Counts for students who like only mayonnaise go in the Yes/Like Mayonnaise and No/Like Pickles box. Counts for students who like only pickles go in the No/Like Mayonnaise and Yes/Like Pickles box. Note: A Venn diagram like the one below may be used as well, depending on student understanding and at teacher discretion. Next, ask the students sitting down the following questions: How many students like both pickles AND mayonnaise? Answers will vary by class. What is the probability that a randomly selected student at the board likes both pickles AND mayonnaise? Answers will vary by class. The probability should be calculated by dividing the number of people who are standing under \u201cBoth\u201d (number given in Step 9(a)) by the number of students at the board (number given in Step 8). Now, ask a student from the audience: How many students like pickles? Answers will vary by class. Note: Avoid phrasing the question with \u201cStudents that like ONLY pickles.\u201d Students need to see that students who like \u201cBoth\u201d items also belong to the groups liking the individual items.

Inform them that, today, they will learn how to calculate proportions when multiple events happen. Review the basic idea of computing probabilities; in other words, the number of outcomes we are interested in divided by the total number of outcomes possible. Pose the questions below to the class. Note: They do not need to come up with specific answers; this is a time for them to make suggestions. How would we compute the probability of two outcomes occurring at the same time? For example, what is the probability that a randomly chosen student likes both pickles AND mayonnaise? How would we compute the probability of either of two outcomes occurring? For example, what is the probability that a randomly chosen student likes either pickles OR mayonnaise? For both questions, steer the students towards using the definition from Step 2. That is, we want the students to realize that they can count the number of people that qualify for the given circumstance and divide by the total number of people to calculate a probability. In order to define AND/OR probabilities, students will participate in an activity where they are grouped by their food preferences. Divide the board into 4 groups and write the words \u201cPickles,\u201d \u201cBoth,\u201d \u201cMayonnaise,\u201d and \u201cNone,\u201d in that order, from left to right. Ask for 10 volunteers to stand by the word that represents their preferences. That is, if they only like pickles, they should stand by the word \u201cPickles.\u201d If they like both pickles and mayonnaise, they should stand by the word \u201cBoth.\u201d Note: If all 4 groups do not have at least one student in them, select a few more students to stand at the board. Ask the remaining students (those still seated) to count the total number of people standing by the board and have a student volunteer share the answer with the class. Answers will vary by class. Next, create a 2-way frequency table like the one below to organize the values of student preferences as follows: Counts for students who like both go in the Yes/Like Mayonnaise and Yes/Like Pickles box. Counts for students who like none go in the No/Like Mayonnaise and No/Like Pickles box Counts for students who like only mayonnaise go in the Yes/Like Mayonnaise and No/Like Pickles box. Counts for students who like only pickles go in the No/Like Mayonnaise and Yes/Like Pickles box. Note: A Venn diagram like the one below may be used as well, depending on student understanding and at teacher discretion. Next, ask the students sitting down the following questions: How many students like both pickles AND mayonnaise? Answers will vary by class. What is the probability that a randomly selected student at the board likes both pickles AND mayonnaise? Answers will vary by class. The probability should be calculated by dividing the number of people who are standing under \u201cBoth\u201d (number given in Step 9(a)) by the number of students at the board (number given in Step 8). Now, ask a student from the audience: How many students like pickles? Answers will vary by class. Note: Avoid phrasing the question with \u201cStudents that like ONLY pickles.\u201d Students need to see that students who like \u201cBoth\u201d items also belong to the groups liking the individual items.

Materials: 3\u201d x 5\u201d cards (1 per student) Vocabulary: chance simulations randomness shuffle Essential Concepts: Essential Concepts: We can \"shuffle\" data based on categorical variables. The statistic we use is the difference in proportions. The distribution we form by shuffling represents what happens if chance were the only factor at play. If the actual observed difference in proportions is near the center of this shuffling distribution, then we would conclude that chance is a good explanation for the difference. But if it is extreme (in the tails or off the charts), then we should conclude that chance is NOT to blame. Sometimes, the apparent difference between groups is caused by chance. Lesson: Data Collection Monitoring: Display the IDS Campaign Monitoring Tool, found at https://portal.idsucla.org . Click on Campaign Monitor and sign in.

How many inactive users are there? Click on pie chart. How many responses were submitted yesterday and today? See Total Responses. How many responses have been shared? How many remain private? Click on pie chart. Using TPS, ask students to think about what they can do to increase their data collection. Conduct a discussion about the data that has been collected. Have students recall what they have learned about chance (see Lesson 8 ). Synonyms: possibility, prospect, expectation, unintentional, unplanned. The actual definition of chance is \u201ca possibility of something happening.\u201d To expand on the flow chart from Lesson 9 (chance \u2192 probability \u2192 simulations), explain that we can use simulations to show that sometimes, when we think two groups are different, the difference is really just because of chance, or randomness , and does not mean anything. This brings us back to \u201cchance\u201d in the flow chart. Remind students that a simulation is a model for creating random outcomes. Randomness means that something just happens without a specific order. In pairs, ask students to name situations where two groups could be compared, and then have the students record these situations in their DS journals. Some examples include: \u2022 Men earn more money than women for some work. \u2022 Basketball players are faster runners than baseball players. \u2022 Los Angeles students are smarter than . \u2022 UCLA football players are better athletes than USC football players. \u2022 You and a friend flipped a coin 10 times, and you got more \"heads.\" Then, ask students to write next to each situation whether they think the differences are either real or due to chance because sometimes differences between two groups are real, but sometimes they might just be due to chance, and they will be learning ways to tell the difference. Explain to the class that we are interested in finding out who will survive by the end of a horror movie. Ask the students: Do you think men and women have an equal likelihood of surviving by the end of a horror movie? Answers will vary by class. Have a few students share out their opinions along with their reasoning. Inform the students that they will be pretending to be actors from horror movies during today\u2019s lesson. Explain that data from horror movies (sometimes called slasher films) were collected of 485 characters from 50 films. For each character, 2 variables were recorded: Gender and Survival. The values for Gender were \u201cMale\u201d and \u201cFemale.\u201d The values for Survival were \u201cDies\u201d and \u201cSurvives.\u201d Gender Survival Female Male Dies 172 228 Survives 50 35 Total 222 263 Notice that there were more male characters than female characters and that most characters in slasher films do not survive. From this data, the proportion of survivors was calculated for each gender. In other words, for all female characters, the number of female survivors was divided by the total number of females. Similarly, for all male characters, the number of male survivors was divided by the total number of males. The percent of females who survived by the end of a horror movie was about 23% , and the percent of males who survived by the end of a horror movie was about 13% . Ask the students: Is this what you expected? (Refer back to the discussion from Step 9.) Answers will vary by class. If students thought males would survive more often, then these results would be unexpected. If students thought females would survive more often, then these results would be exactly what they expected. If students thought there was an equal likelihood of survival, these results would also be surprising. What is the difference in the proportions of survival rates between genders? What does this mean in the context of surviving a horror movie? The difference is 23% - 13% = 10%. This means that 10% more women characters survived than men. Is this difference \u201cbig\u201d or \u201csmall\u201d? How can they define what is \u201cbig\u201d and what is \u201csmall?\u201d Answers will vary by class. Upon first glance, it may seem like 10% is a big difference, but we do not know for sure. Explain that they will participate in an activity to determine if the 10% difference seen in the actual data set is big or small. This will help them determine if there really is a difference in survival rates for males versus females, or if the 10% difference was just due to chance. Split the class into two groups, 46% of them on one side of the room and the other 54% on the other side of the room. Tell the smaller group they have been assigned to play female characters in the horror movie (regardless of their gender) and tell the larger group that they have been assigned to play male characters in the horror movie (regardless of their gender). Once those groups have been created, have the class calculate the number of students in each group that would have survived a horror film using the actual proportions given in Step 14. For example: For a class of 30 students: \u2022 46% of 30 (0.46x30) \u2248 14 students representing female characters. \u2022 Of those 14 female characters, 23%, or 3 (0.23x14 \u2248 3), are survivors. \u2022 The remaining 16 students (30 \u2013 14 = 16) represent male characters. \u2022 Of those 16 male characters, 13%, or 2 (0.13x16 \u2248 2), are survivors. Each group should then decide which students will be survivors. Using the 3\u201d x 5\u201d cards, students should write either \u201cdies\u201d or \u201csurvives\u201d on their card. For example (continued from above): Three of the female characters are survivors; so 3 female characters from the group should write \u201csurvives\u201d on their cards. The rest of the group should write \u201cdies\u201d on their cards. Two of the male characters are survivors; so 2 male characters from the group should write \u201csurvives\u201d on their cards. The rest of the group should write \u201cdies\" on their cards. Explain to students that IF there really is no difference between genders in horror films, then the characters who survived would only have done so by chance. In other words, males and females would have an equal likelihood of surviving. Have students discuss the following questions: How many total people in our class are survivors? What is the total proportion of survivors? Answers will vary by class. Using the example above, there would be a total of 5 survivors from the class of 30 students. The proportion of survivors would be 5/30 = 0.17 = 17% How many of the survivors would we expect to be male? How many would we expect to be female? Answers will vary by class. Using the example above, we would expect to see 17% of males and 17% of females survive since that was the overall proportion of survivors. So, we would expect 0.17x16 \u2248 3 male survivors, and 0.17x14 \u2248 2 female survivors. Collect all of the 3\u201d x 5\u201d cards from the students and explain that you are going to shuffle the cards and redistribute them so that their genders have no influence on whether or not they survive the horror movie. Visibly shuffle the survives/dies cards to create a random shuffle. Once the cards have been well-shuffled, pass them back out to the students face down. After all the cards are given out, each group should identify the number of people that are survivors and calculate the corresponding proportion of the survivors. On the board, create a table to display the proportions of survivors for each gender, and include a column for the difference (female survivors \u2013 male survivors). Fill in the table with the values the students found in Step 20. Note: The first row has been filled in with the example data from above BEFORE the shuffles have taken place. Exact numbers were not used so that the proportions would match the actual horror movie data set. # of Female Survivors # of Male Survivors Proportion of Female Survivors Proportion of Male Survivors Difference in Proportions (Female \u2013 Male) 3.22 2.08 3.22/14 = 0.23 2.08/16 = 0.13 0.23 \u2013 0.13 = 0.10 ? Note that values in the \u201cDifference in Proportions\u201d column can be positive or negative because sometimes more women will survive, and other times more men will survive. Draw a dotplot on the board labeled \u201cDifference in Proportions.\u201d Include a vertical line at 10% to represent the actual difference in gender survival rates in real horror movies (see example below). Using the information from Steps 20 and 21, place a dot at the corresponding value for the shuffled data\u2019s difference in proportions. Ask the students: How does this difference compare to the actual data set\u2019s difference of 10%? Answers will vary by class. Most likely, the difference in proportions will be much smaller than 10%. In fact, the difference in proportions will be centered around 0. Repeat Steps 19 \u2013 24 a few more times (depending on how much class time you have available). Ask the students to record their responses to the following questions: What was the biggest difference we saw from our shuffles? What was the smallest? Answers will vary by class. What do you think this dotplot would look like if we shuffled our survival cards 1000 times? The dotplot would look roughly symmetric and centered around 0, meaning that if there were no relationship between a character\u2019s gender and whether or not they survive, the difference in proportions would typically be 0. Have a discussion about how the actual difference in gender survival (10%) is rarely seen when we assign \u201csurvives\u201d or \u201cdies\u201d just by chance (aka when shuffling). What does this mean in terms of who will die in actual horror movies? Since we never (or rarely) saw a 10% difference in the proportions of female survivors versus male survivors, it seems that horror movies actually favor female survivors. Ask the students: If you were going to be cast in a horror movie, would you want to be a male character or a female character? You would want to be a female character because they are more likely to survive by the end of the film. Inform the students that they will learn how to shuffle in RStudio in order to determine if an event is real or simply due to chance.

This brings us back to \u201cchance\u201d in the flow chart. Remind students that a simulation is a model for creating random outcomes. Randomness means that something just happens without a specific order. In pairs, ask students to name situations where two groups could be compared, and then have the students record these situations in their DS journals. Some examples include: \u2022 Men earn more money than women for some work. \u2022 Basketball players are faster runners than baseball players. \u2022 Los Angeles students are smarter than . \u2022 UCLA football players are better athletes than USC football players. \u2022 You and a friend flipped a coin 10 times, and you got more \"heads.\" Then, ask students to write next to each situation whether they think the differences are either real or due to chance because sometimes differences between two groups are real, but sometimes they might just be due to chance, and they will be learning ways to tell the difference. Explain to the class that we are interested in finding out who will survive by the end of a horror movie. Ask the students: Do you think men and women have an equal likelihood of surviving by the end of a horror movie? Answers will vary by class. Have a few students share out their opinions along with their reasoning. Inform the students that they will be pretending to be actors from horror movies during today\u2019s lesson. Explain that data from horror movies (sometimes called slasher films) were collected of 485 characters from 50 films. For each character, 2 variables were recorded: Gender and Survival. The values for Gender were \u201cMale\u201d and \u201cFemale.\u201d The values for Survival were \u201cDies\u201d and \u201cSurvives.\u201d Gender Survival Female Male Dies 172 228 Survives 50 35 Total 222 263 Notice that there were more male characters than female characters and that most characters in slasher films do not survive. From this data, the proportion of survivors was calculated for each gender. In other words, for all female characters, the number of female survivors was divided by the total number of females. Similarly, for all male characters, the number of male survivors was divided by the total number of males. The percent of females who survived by the end of a horror movie was about 23% , and the percent of males who survived by the end of a horror movie was about 13% . Ask the students: Is this what you expected? (Refer back to the discussion from Step 9.) Answers will vary by class. If students thought males would survive more often, then these results would be unexpected. If students thought females would survive more often, then these results would be exactly what they expected. If students thought there was an equal likelihood of survival, these results would also be surprising. What is the difference in the proportions of survival rates between genders? What does this mean in the context of surviving a horror movie? The difference is 23% - 13% = 10%. This means that 10% more women characters survived than men. Is this difference \u201cbig\u201d or \u201csmall\u201d? How can they define what is \u201cbig\u201d and what is \u201csmall?\u201d Answers will vary by class. Upon first glance, it may seem like 10% is a big difference, but we do not know for sure. Explain that they will participate in an activity to determine if the 10% difference seen in the actual data set is big or small. This will help them determine if there really is a difference in survival rates for males versus females, or if the 10% difference was just due to chance. Split the class into two groups, 46% of them on one side of the room and the other 54% on the other side of the room. Tell the smaller group they have been assigned to play female characters in the horror movie (regardless of their gender) and tell the larger group that they have been assigned to play male characters in the horror movie (regardless of their gender). Once those groups have been created, have the class calculate the number of students in each group that would have survived a horror film using the actual proportions given in Step 14. For example: For a class of 30 students: \u2022 46% of 30 (0.46x30) \u2248 14 students representing female characters. \u2022 Of those 14 female characters, 23%, or 3 (0.23x14 \u2248 3), are survivors. \u2022 The remaining 16 students (30 \u2013 14 = 16) represent male characters. \u2022 Of those 16 male characters, 13%, or 2 (0.13x16 \u2248 2), are survivors. Each group should then decide which students will be survivors. Using the 3\u201d x 5\u201d cards, students should write either \u201cdies\u201d or \u201csurvives\u201d on their card. For example (continued from above): Three of the female characters are survivors; so 3 female characters from the group should write \u201csurvives\u201d on their cards. The rest of the group should write \u201cdies\u201d on their cards. Two of the male characters are survivors; so 2 male characters from the group should write \u201csurvives\u201d on their cards. The rest of the group should write \u201cdies\" on their cards. Explain to students that IF there really is no difference between genders in horror films, then the characters who survived would only have done so by chance. In other words, males and females would have an equal likelihood of surviving. Have students discuss the following questions: How many total people in our class are survivors? What is the total proportion of survivors? Answers will vary by class. Using the example above, there would be a total of 5 survivors from the class of 30 students. The proportion of survivors would be 5/30 = 0.17 = 17% How many of the survivors would we expect to be male? How many would we expect to be female? Answers will vary by class. Using the example above, we would expect to see 17% of males and 17% of females survive since that was the overall proportion of survivors. So, we would expect 0.17x16 \u2248 3 male survivors, and 0.17x14 \u2248 2 female survivors. Collect all of the 3\u201d x 5\u201d cards from the students and explain that you are going to shuffle the cards and redistribute them so that their genders have no influence on whether or not they survive the horror movie. Visibly shuffle the survives/dies cards to create a random shuffle. Once the cards have been well-shuffled, pass them back out to the students face down. After all the cards are given out, each group should identify the number of people that are survivors and calculate the corresponding proportion of the survivors. On the board, create a table to display the proportions of survivors for each gender, and include a column for the difference (female survivors \u2013 male survivors). Fill in the table with the values the students found in Step 20. Note: The first row has been filled in with the example data from above BEFORE the shuffles have taken place. Exact numbers were not used so that the proportions would match the actual horror movie data set. # of Female Survivors # of Male Survivors Proportion of Female Survivors Proportion of Male Survivors Difference in Proportions (Female \u2013 Male) 3.22 2.08 3.22/14 = 0.23 2.08/16 = 0.13 0.23 \u2013 0.13 = 0.10 ? Note that values in the \u201cDifference in Proportions\u201d column can be positive or negative because sometimes more women will survive, and other times more men will survive. Draw a dotplot on the board labeled \u201cDifference in Proportions.\u201d Include a vertical line at 10% to represent the actual difference in gender survival rates in real horror movies (see example below). Using the information from Steps 20 and 21, place a dot at the corresponding value for the shuffled data\u2019s difference in proportions. Ask the students: How does this difference compare to the actual data set\u2019s difference of 10%? Answers will vary by class. Most likely, the difference in proportions will be much smaller than 10%. In fact, the difference in proportions will be centered around 0. Repeat Steps 19 \u2013 24 a few more times (depending on how much class time you have available). Ask the students to record their responses to the following questions: What was the biggest difference we saw from our shuffles? What was the smallest? Answers will vary by class. What do you think this dotplot would look like if we shuffled our survival cards 1000 times? The dotplot would look roughly symmetric and centered around 0, meaning that if there were no relationship between a character\u2019s gender and whether or not they survive, the difference in proportions would typically be 0. Have a discussion about how the actual difference in gender survival (10%) is rarely seen when we assign \u201csurvives\u201d or \u201cdies\u201d just by chance (aka when shuffling). What does this mean in terms of who will die in actual horror movies? Since we never (or rarely) saw a 10% difference in the proportions of female survivors versus male survivors, it seems that horror movies actually favor female survivors. Ask the students: If you were going to be cast in a horror movie, would you want to be a male character or a female character? You would want to be a female character because they are more likely to survive by the end of the film. Inform the students that they will learn how to shuffle in RStudio in order to determine if an event is real or simply due to chance.","title":"Lesson:"},{"location":"unit2/lesson13/#class-scribes","text":"One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.","title":"Class Scribes:"},{"location":"unit2/lesson13/#homework-next-day","text":"For the next 5 days, students will collect data for the Stress/Chill campaign either through the UCLA IDS UCLA App or via web browser at https://portal.idsucla.org LAB 2E: The Horror Movie Shuffle Complete Lab 2E prior to Lesson 14 .","title":"Homework &amp; Next Day"},{"location":"unit2/lesson14/","text":"Lesson 14: The Titanic Shuffle Objective: Students will continue to understand that, just by chance, we will see differences between two groups.

The statistic we use is the difference in medians. The distribution we form by this form of shuffling still represents what happens if chance were the only factor at play. When differences are small, we suspect that they might be due to chance. When differences are big, we suspect they might be 'real'. Lesson: Remind students that they previously learned how to determine if a difference is due to chance by shuffling based on categorical variables (gender and survival). Display the dotplot created during Lesson 13 of the difference in proportions between female and survivors of horror movies. Remind the students that, \"by chance,\" the differences were typically zero . Most of the time, they were pretty small. Sometimes they were bigger, but that was rare and this tells us that if we see \"small\" differences, we might think they are due to chance. But if we see \"big\" differences, they are not. Lead a short discussion about what students think small and big differences mean. Make sure they answer in units (which are percentage points for the horror movie data). So, for example, a \"big\" difference might be 5 percentage points (but don't let them just say \"5\"). Inform students that, during today\u2019s lesson, they will learn how to determine if there is a difference between groups when a numerical variable is involved. In particular, they will assume the roles of passengers in the Titanic for today\u2019s lesson. In case some students may not know about the Titanic , ask a volunteer to share what he/she knows. Explain that, at its time, the Titanic was the largest cruise ship ever built and was declared to be unsinkable. However, on its first voyage, it sank and was one of the worst maritime disasters in history. About 40% of passengers survived; however, your chances of survival depended very much on your age, gender, and wealth. Inform the students that we are going to look at whether the amount of money a passenger paid for his/her cabin (the fare price) had anything to do with whether or not he/she survived. Each student will need a strip from the LMR_Titanic Strips file\u2014see below for instructions. Advanced preparation required: The Titanic Strips LMR contains data from 40 actual passengers on the titanic. Each strip represents the data from one passenger: the left hand side shows the fare paid and right hand side contains the survival information of that passenger after the collision. Cut the LMR into strips such that the fare price is attached to the survivor status for each of the 40 observations. LMR_Titanic Strips 40 strips were created for large classes. If your class has less than 40 students, assign the students to two groups such that roughly 40% of them are in the survivor group (15/40 = 37.5% \u2248 40%), and the rest are in the victim group. If your class is small (smaller than 10), then put the students in two equal sized groups. The split does not have to be exactly 40%, as the actual value from our data is 38.8%. Inform the smaller group that they are the survivors and distribute a survivor strip with its corresponding fare to each student. Set aside any leftover strips. Tell them that the price on the strip represents the amount of money paid for their ticket to board the Titanic . Notify them that \u00a320 in 1912 is worth about \u00a31126 today. Divulge to the larger group that they, unfortunately, are the victims and distribute a victim strip with its corresponding fare to each student. Set aside any leftover strips. Ask each group to create a dotplot of their fare prices on a poster. Lead a quick discussion comparing the two dotplots visually. Then, ask each group to calculate the median fare for their group. As a class, find the difference between the median fares for the two groups. median of \u201cSurvivor\u201d fares \u2013 median of \u201cVictim\u201d fares For example: If all 15 survivor cards and all 25 victim cards are used, the difference is medians would be: \u00a326.00 \u2013 \u00a313.00 = \u00a313.00 Explain that one of the controversies of the Titanic disaster was that some people felt that the rich people were given better access to the lifeboats than were the poor, so rich people were more likely to survive. Note that the data represented on the fare cards are only a subset of the actual Titanic data, which had over 800 passengers. However, the data were randomly selected from the real data and are considered representative of the 800 passengers. In pairs, ask students to discuss the following: Based on the data from our dotplots, do you think rich people were more likely to survive? In other words, did passengers who paid more for their tickets have a better chance of survival? Yes, there is evidence that rich passengers survived more often than poorer passengers. The median difference between the fare prices of the survivors and the victims is \u00a313.00 (see Step 13). Most survivors had higher fare prices than the victims, so the distribution of survivor fares is shifted to the right and is more right-skewed. Share out a couple of responses with the whole class. Have students tear their strip such that they separate the fare from the outcome (survivor or victim). Collect only the outcomes and randomly shuffle them. Students will keep their fare. Distribute the shuffled outcome strips face down to the students. Once everyone has a new outcome strip, ask students to turn their outcome strip over and re-group based on their new survival status. Ask the students: Why do we shuffle the survivor/victim strips and not the fare strips? We want to know if the price someone paid for his/her ticket affects whether or not he/she survived. So, when we shuffle, we assume that fare price has nothing to do with survival, so the prices should be irrelevant. What do you think the median fare difference of our shuffled groups will be? The median fare difference of the shuffled groups should be close to 0, meaning that there should be NO difference in fare price for the survivors and the victims. Everyone would have the same chances of surviving, regardless of their ticket price. Have each group calculate the median fare price for their new groups. Then, ask: Do you think this difference, of ___ dollars, is real or due to chance? Answers will vary by class. Since the data were shuffled, any difference should be due to chance. On the board, create a table to display the median fare prices for each group, and include a column for the difference (median \u201cSurvivor\u201d fare \u2013 median \u201cVictim\u201d fare). Fill in the table with the values the students found in Step 13. Note: The first row has been filled in with the example data from above BEFORE the shuffles have taken place. Median Fare Price of Survivors Median Fare Price of Victims Difference in Medians (Survivors - Victims) \u00a326.00 \u00a313.00 \u00a326.00 - \u00a313.00 = \u00a313.00 ? Note that values in the \u201cDifference in Medians\u201d column can be positive or negative because sometimes the survivors will pay more for their tickets, and other times the victims will pay more for their tickets. Draw a dotplot on the board labeled \u201cDifference in Medians.\u201d Include a vertical line at \u00a313.00 (or whatever value was calculated in Step 13 by the class) to represent the actual difference in the median fare prices between the survivors and the victims (see example below). Using the information from Steps 19 and 20, place a dot at the corresponding value for the shuffled data\u2019s difference in medians. Ask the students: How does this difference compare to the actual difference of \u00a313.00 (from Step 13)? Answers will vary by class. Most likely, the difference in medians will be much smaller than \u00a313.00. In fact, the difference in medians will be centered around 0. Remind students that small differences might be due to chance and big differences typically mean that there is a \u201creal\u201d difference between groups. In this case, a big difference might mean that the rich passengers were more likely to survive. And a small difference might mean that survival was just a matter of plain luck. Repeat Steps 17 \u2013 23 a few more times (depending on how much class time you have available). In pairs, ask students to discuss whether they think the real difference in median fare prices they calculated in Step 13 (\u00a313.00 if all cards were used) is small or large. Answers will vary by class. Guide students to look at the MAD value of the distribution of differences in median fares. Explain that one way that we can decide what is \u201clarge\u201d or \u201csmall\u201d is by creating cut-off values that we think are too far away from the center of the distributions of differences. In general, we can assign a rule that states that any difference in median fare prices that is greater than 2 MAD values above or below the median is considered unusual. This means that any value in the outer edges of the plot would indicate that a passenger\u2019s ticket price impacted his/her chances of survival. Inform students that they will use RStudio to shuffle the actual Titanic data of all 800 passengers during the next class and can decide if the difference in survival rates of rich passengers and poor passengers was real, or just due to chance.

(2) Is there a difference between the sorts of things that stress out the different personality colors? In order to answer the above questions, we will need to merge our class\u2019s 2 data sets together ( Personality Color and Stress/Chill ). In order to do this, we will be practicing how to merge data sets today. Print out the material from the Tangible Data Merging file ( LMR_2.14 ). Use a different color of paper for each of the two data sets. For example, Data set 1 could be on plain white paper and Data set 2 could be on blue paper. Cut the paper by creating horizontal strips of each observation of data. For example, from the screenshot below, of the first page of Data Set 1, you would create 12 different strips of paper, one for each observation. LMR_2.14 Hand each student in the class a strip of paper. Ask them to try to find someone with the other data set (i.e., a person with a different colored strip of paper) that they can \u201cmatch up,\u201d or merge , with. For example, a student with the first row of data listed below from Data set 1 might want to match up with the second row of data listed below from Data set 2 because a person who is 21 has probably graduated high school.

They should realize that only 3 of the variables are the same in both data sets: Birth Month , Zip Code , and ID Number . Since multiple people have the same Birth Month , discuss why this may not be the best variable to merge with. Multiple people are born in January, so we would have no way of differentiating between those people. The same is true for the Zip Codes variable. Although there are less repeats with Zip Codes , we still see some overlap between observations. So, the only UNIQUE identifier in both data sets is ID Number . So the students should end up in pairs at the end of the exercise \u2013 a student from Data set 1 is matched with the student from Data set 2 that has the same ID Number .

Objective: Students will learn what a Normal distribution is and learn how to identify a Normal distribution. Materials: Video: New York Times\u2019 \u201cBunnies, Dragons, and the Normal World\u201d found at: http://www.nytimes.com/video/science/100000002452709/bunnies-dragons-and-the-normal-world.html Note: Show only the first 41 seconds of the video.

Lesson: Remind students that in Unit 1 , Lesson 11 ( What Shape Are You In? ), they sorted histograms into groups based on their shapes. The Normal Plots file ( LMR_2.15 ) contains some of the unimodal bell-shaped distributions from the original handout of that lesson ( Sorting Histograms handout ( LMR_1.10 )). Note: You do not need the original handout from Unit 1 \u2013 all relevant plots have been compiled in the Normal Plots file ( LMR_2.15 ) for accessibility. Six plots are included: SAT Math, SAT Verb, ACT Mathematics, ACT Reading, ACT English, and ACT Science Reasoning. LMR_2.15 Display the group of bell-shaped distributions from page 1 of the Normal Plots file ( LMR_2.15 ) to the class and ask the students: What characteristic does this particular group share? All of these plots are unimodal (one mode/peak) and symmetric. Inform students that these types of distributions are often referred to as bell-shaped. Why might this term be used? The histograms look very similar to the shape of a bell. To show the similarities between the shape of a bell and the shape of these distributions, a clip-art image (shown here) has been included in the Normal Plots file ( LMR_2.15 ) on page 2. Explain that this shape occurs often in real-life. It occurs so often that it\u2019s been given its own name: the normal curve , or normal distribution . Can the students think of distributions where they have seen Normal curves in previous labs? To give some more background on the normal distribution, play the New York Times video titled \u201cBunnies, Dragons, and the Normal World\u201d found at: http://www.nytimes.com/video/science/100000002452709/bunnies-dragons-and-the-normal-world.html Note: Show only the first 41 seconds of the video. Discuss that the normal curve has a very precise mathematical definition, which is pretty complex. But the result is a curve that looks like the one in the \u201cBunnies\u201d video. In general, the curve looks like the plot shown below. Note: You can either draw the diagram below on the board or display it via a projector \u2013 the image can be found on page 2 of the Normal Plots file ( LMR_2.15 ). Explain that normal distributions are good for describing some populations of people. For example, people\u2019s heights are often considered to be normally distributed. Display the famous Frank Anscombe photograph (shown below) via a projector. The graphic can be found on page 2 of the Normal Plots file ( LMR_2.15 ). Inform the students that this photo was taken of a group of randomly selected college women who stood in height order. Next, lead a discussion about why the normal curve is a good fit to the histogram in the above picture. Notice that more people are near the center of the distribution, and fewer are in the outer edges, or tails. Engage the class in a conversation using the following probing questions: Notice that there is a peak in the center of the distribution. What height do you think is at the center? The average height of American women is approximately 5\u20195\u201d (5 feet, 5 inches) tall. We might therefore expect the average height of this group to be close to 5'5\" as well. Why are more people in the center, and less people in the edges, or tails, of the distribution? The center represents the mean height. Most women will fall somewhere close to the mean and may be a few inches shorter or taller than it. However, less people are likely to be MUCH shorter or MUCH taller than the mean. For example, we would not expect to see many women who are 4\u201910\u201d tall nor would we expect to see many women who are 6\u20190\u201d tall. Explain that the normal curve is a good description of a distribution when it makes sense that there is a single 'typical' value with random deviations above and below that value. Ask students: Why does this make sense with heights but not with incomes? With heights, we expect most people to be near the average, with some deviations above and below the mean (people who are taller or shorter than the mean height). However, with incomes, the distribution will have more deviations that are above the typical value, since there is no upper bound for a maximum income (ex. Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, etc. Are there more real-life examples, other than height, that students think might follow a normal distribution? Answers will vary by class. Some examples include: (1) scores on standardized math and reading tests (like the SAT and ACT), (2) IQ scores, and (3) body temperatures. Does it matter that the curve drawn on the photograph does not match exactly to the women\u2019s heights? No. We often refer to the curve as the \u201cnormal model\u201d because the curve is a just a model of the true population distribution. So, even though the red curve is not exactly the same as the women\u2019s heights, it is a close enough approximation of the shape of their heights. Note to teacher: The main role the normal distribution has historically played has been in modeling errors (most measurements will be close to the actual value while larger errors occur less often) and sample means. Inform the students that, during the next few lessons, they will be learning more about the normal distribution. In particular, they will learn about a new measure of spread used to describe a normal distribution, how to calculate probabilities from this distribution, and how to randomly sample from this distribution. Cheat Card: Distribute an index card to students and ask them to create a cheat card that will help them remember information about the normal curve. Class Scribes: One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were. Homework Students will complete their cheat cards if they were not able to finish in class.","title":"Lesson 16: What Is Normal?"},{"location":"unit2/lesson16/#lesson-16-what-is-normal","text":"","title":"Lesson 16: What is Normal?"},{"location":"unit2/lesson16/#objective","text":"Students will learn what a Normal distribution is and learn how to identify a Normal distribution.","title":"Objective:"},{"location":"unit2/lesson16/#materials","text":"Video: New York Times\u2019 \u201cBunnies, Dragons, and the Normal World\u201d found at: http://www.nytimes.com/video/science/100000002452709/bunnies-dragons-and-the-normal-world.html Note: Show only the first 41 seconds of the video.

This is commonly used by statisticians because of its role in common models and distributions, such as the Normal Model. Lesson: In their DS journals, ask students to create a two-column table and label the left-column as Measures of Center (Central Tendency) and the right column as Measures of Spread (Dispersion) . In pairs, ask students to recall methods they have learned so far for measuring center and measuring spread in distributions. Measures of Center: mean (average or typical value), median Measures of Spread: mean absolute deviation (MAD), interquartile range (IQR) Share out a pair\u2019s explanation and ask the rest of the pairs to agree or disagree. If there is disagreement, hold a class discussion until the lists are correct. Point out that a measure of center or a measure of spread depicts one value for a distribution. Ask student pairs to discuss the following question: What does the value of each measure tell us about the data in the distribution? Possible answer: A measure of center tells us the value that is typical, or in the center. A measure of spread tells us how variable, or how spread apart, the data are. Next, ask students to add the term standard deviation (SD) to their Measures of Spread column. Inform students that the standard deviation of a distribution is another way to measure spread, or variability. The standard deviation is similar to the mean absolute deviation (MAD). Ask students to recall the formula for calculating the MAD: While the MAD measures the absolute distance of each data point from the mean, the standard deviation squares the distances of each data point from the mean. Both methods result in positive measurements because distance is always positive. Ask students to recall that they calculated MAD values in the How Far Apart? handout ( LMR_2.6 ) during Lesson 4 of this unit. Show and discuss the formula for calculating the standard deviation of a data set: Note to teacher: There are different formulas for the standard deviation. We are presenting the simpler one, which divides by n. In AP Statistics (or college introductory statistics), students will learn that if they are using a sample of data to estimate the standard deviation for the population, then dividing by n\u22121 is a better estimator than dividing by n. But this technically requires a lot of scaffolding and leads to little understanding, and so we will stick with the simpler version. (In some books, this is called the \u201cpopulation value of the standard deviation\u201d and the n\u22121 version is called the \u201csample estimate of the standard deviation.\u201d) Guide the class to complete the How Far Apart? (with standard deviation -- SD) handout ( LMR_2.16 ) to calculate standard deviations of the dotplots using the formula listed above. LMR_2.16 Answers: Plot (a) \u2013 SD = 1.0847 candies; Plot (c) \u2013 SD = 1.3770 candies As a whole group, ask students to compare and contrast the standard deviations with the MAD values for the two plots in the handout. Similarities between SD and MAD: \u2022 Measure the same idea: variability, or spread \u2022 Are based on looking at the \"deviations\" from the mean: the difference between an observation and the mean \u2022 Uses the \"typical\" deviation Differences between SD and MAD: \u2022 The MAD uses the absolute value and finds the average of the absolute deviations from the mean \u2022 The SD uses the square of each deviation from the mean, and finds the average of the squares \u2022 The SD takes the square root of the average of the squares Ask students why they think the SD takes the square root of the average of the squares. Possible response: Taking the square root of the average of the squares returns the measurements to their original units instead of square units. To reinforce students\u2019 conceptual understanding of standard deviation, student teams will estimate the standard deviation for a few numerical distributions and explain the reasoning for their estimate. Load and view the atus data, then run the following functions one by one: > histogram(~sleep, data=atus, breaks=seq(0,1500,by=100), main = \u201cDistribution of sleep in minutes\u201d) > sleep_mean<-mean(~sleep, data=atus) > add_line(vline=sleep_mean) Zoom in on the visual and give student teams a few minutes to discuss what they estimate the standard deviation to be. Have the reporter from each team report their estimate using the following sentence frame: \u201cThe time spent sleeping (in minutes) typically varies from the mean by minutes.\u201d Reveal the actual standard deviation by running the function: > sd(~sleep, data=atus) Choose a reporter from a student team that had a good approximation to explain their reasoning.

To reinforce students\u2019 conceptual understanding of standard deviation, student teams will estimate the standard deviation for a few numerical distributions and explain the reasoning for their estimate. Load and view the atus data, then run the following functions one by one: > histogram(~sleep, data=atus, breaks=seq(0,1500,by=100), main = \u201cDistribution of sleep in minutes\u201d) > sleep_mean<-mean(~sleep, data=atus) > add_line(vline=sleep_mean) Zoom in on the visual and give student teams a few minutes to discuss what they estimate the standard deviation to be. Have the reporter from each team report their estimate using the following sentence frame: \u201cThe time spent sleeping (in minutes) typically varies from the mean by minutes.\u201d Reveal the actual standard deviation by running the function: > sd(~sleep, data=atus) Choose a reporter from a student team that had a good approximation to explain their reasoning. Repeat this process with a few more numerical variables. Functions are provided below. Household size > histogram(~household_size, data=atus, nint=13) > household_mean<-mean(~household_size, data=atus) > add_line(vline=household_mean) \u201cHousehold sizes typically vary from the mean by people.\u201d > sd(~household_size, data=atus) Socializing > histogram(~socializing, data=atus, breaks=seq(0,2000,by=100)) > social_mean<-mean(~socializing, data=atus) > add_line(vline=social_mean) \u201cThe time spent socializing (in minutes) typically varies from the mean by minutes.\u201d > sd(~socializing, data=atus)","title":"Lesson:"},{"location":"unit2/lesson17/#class-scribes","text":"One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.","title":"Class Scribes:"},{"location":"unit2/lesson18/","text":"Lesson 18: What's Your Z-Score? Objective: Students will understand that a z-score can be used to measure how far - or how many standard deviations - an observation is away from the mean. Typically z-scores will range between -3 and +3. For simulations involving shuffling, if we compute a z-score that lies far away from the mean, then we might conclude that the outcome was not due to chance. If we see a z-score that lies close to the mean, then we might conclude it was by chance. Materials: Projector to display RStudio function RScript with all of the functions in this lesson A ruler with centimeter marks on it Vocabulary: z-score standardized score Empirical Rule Essential Concepts: Essential Concepts: z-scores offer us a way to measure how extreme a value is, regardless of the units of measurement. Typically z-scores will range between -3 and +3, so values that are at or are more extreme than -3 or +3 standard deviations are considered extremely rare. Lesson: Ask students to recall what they remember about normal distributions. Answer: Normal distributions are unimodal and symmetric, and are often referred to as bell-shaped. Some real-life examples of variables that produce normal distributions are people\u2019s heights, scores on standardized tests, and body temperatures. Display the following statement to students: \u201cAll normal distributions are bell-shaped, but not all bell-shaped distributions are normal.\u201d Then inform students that normal distributions have special properties. Display the image below and introduce the Empirical Rule , which states: \u2022 Approximately 68% of the observations in a normal distribution fall within one standard deviation of the mean \u2022 Approximately 95% of the observations in a normal distribution fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean \u2022 Approximately 99.7% of the observations in a normal distribution fall within 3 standard deviations of the mean Open RStudio and project for students to see. Load the babies dataset, named Gestation by following these steps: Enter data(Gestation) in the Console You should see Gestation located in your Environment Enter View(Gestation) in the Console Display the help documentation by typing ?Gestation . Ask student teams to predict which of the variables in the \"Gestation\" dataset they think might be normally distributed. Choose a couple of teams to share out. Description of numerical variables: wt - birth weight (in ounces) gestation - length of the pregnancy (in days) parity - 0 if baby was first born, 1-13 otherwise age - mother\u2019s age (in years) ht - mother\u2019s height (to the last completed inch) wt.1 - mother\u2019s weight (in pounds) dage - father's age (in years) dht - father's height (to the last completed inch) dwt - father's weight (in pounds) Create histograms using the variables shared by student teams. There are a few variables that look normally distributed, such as the birth mother's heights. We will investigate the babies\u2019 birth weights. histogram(~wt, data = Gestation) Ask students: Does the distribution of baby birth weights look approximately normal? Explain. Answer: The distribution of baby birth weights is unimodal, roughly symmetric, and somewhat bell-shaped, so it might be approximately normal. What do you approximate the mean weight of the distribution to be? How about the standard deviation? Answers will vary. Use this as a check for understanding of standard deviation as well as estimating the mean using the balancing point concept. See next step for calculating the actual mean weight and standard deviation. Use RStudio to calculate the actual mean and standard deviation. mean_wt <- mean(~wt, data = Gestation) sd_wt <- sd(~wt, data = Gestation) Have students draw a number line with seven equally spaced intervals and label it \u201cBaby birth weights in ounces.\u201d Make sure students leave about 5 centimeters of space above the number line to draw a normal curve. Have students label the middle tick mark with the mean baby weight (round to the nearest tenth of an ounce=119.6 ounces). Then ask students: What weight is one standard deviation above the mean? Answer: A baby whose weight is 137.8 ounces is one standard deviation above the mean baby weight. What weight is one standard deviation below the mean? Answer: A baby whose weight is 101.4 ounces is one standard deviation below the mean baby weight. Have students label their number line with these values. Have students continue filling their number line with the corresponding weights that are two and three standard deviations from the mean. Answer: A baby who weighs 156 ounces is two standard deviations above the mean weight, and a baby who weighs 174.2 ounces is three standard deviations above the mean weight. A baby who weighs 83.2 ounces is two standard deviations below the mean weight, and a baby who weighs 65 ounces is three standard deviations below the mean weight. Ask students: If the distribution of baby weights is approximately normal, what percentage of babies weigh between 101.4 ounces and 137.8 ounces? Answer: If the distribution of baby weights is approximately normal, about 68% of babies should weigh between 101.4 ounces and 137.8 ounces. Use RStudio to confirm if indeed the distribution of baby weights is approximately normal. one_sd_wt <- filter(Gestation, wt > 101.4, wt < 137.8) Answer: In this sample of 1236 observations, there are 861 babies whose weights are one standard deviation from the mean, so 861/1236 = 0.697. This means that around 69.7% of the weights of the babies in this sample fall within one standard deviation from the mean baby weight. This is close to 68%, so it seems that the distribution of baby weights is approximately normally distributed. Note: If you continue this process for this sample, you will find that the distribution of baby weights is normally distributed as defined by the Empirical Rule. In this sample, 1171/1236 = 94.7% of the baby weights fall within two standard deviations of the mean, and 1229/1236 =99.4% of the baby weights fall within three standard deviations of the mean. Now that it has been verified that a normal distribution is an appropriate model for this distribution, have students draw a normal curve above the number line. Suggested method to obtain a decent normal curve: \u2022 Step 1: Draw a dot 4 centimeters above the mean weight \u2022 Step 2: Draw dots 2.4 cm above the weights that are 1 standard deviation from the mean \u2022 Step 3: Draw dots 0.36 cm above the weights that are 2 standard deviations from the mean \u2022 Step 4: Draw dots right above the number line for the weights that are 3 standard deviations from the mean \u2022 Step 5: Connect the dots with a smooth curve Tell students that we are using this normal curve as a model to represent the distribution of all baby weights. This will allow us to make comparisons, draw conclusions, and make predictions about baby weights. Let\u2019s see: What percentage of babies weigh less than 119.6 ounces? Explain. Answer: About 50% of babies weigh less than 119.6 ounces. Since normal distributions are symmetric, the mean and the median are about the same. Since the median divides a distribution into equal halves, in this case so does the mean. What percentage of babies weigh between 119.6 and 137.8 ounces? Answer: About 34% of babies weigh between 119.6 and 137.8 ounces. According to the Empirical Rule, 68% of the observations fall within one standard deviation of the mean, and since normal distributions are symmetric, the area under the curve from the mean to one standard deviation is half of 68% or 34%. What percentage of babies weigh more than 137.8 ounces? Answer: About 16% of babies weigh more than 137.8 ounces. From part a and b above, we know that 50%+34%=84% of babies weigh less than 137.8 ounces, so 100%-84%=16% weigh more than 137.8 ounces. Explain that statisticians use something called a z-score to compare values. A z-score tells us how many standard deviations away from the mean an observation is. Another name for z-score is a standardized score . Introduce the formula for calculating a z-score and discuss what each symbol in the formula means. Explain that z-scores answer the question: \u201cHow typical is x?\u201d If x is the same as the typical value (the mean), then z = 0. If x is one standard deviation away from the mean, then z = -1 or +1. Remind students from the normal curve that as you move farther from the center (from the mean), there are fewer observations. Therefore, a large z-score is considered an unusual value. Have students calculate the z-score for a baby that weighs 100 ounces: z = (100 - 119.6) / 18.2 = -1.08 Ask the class: What does a negative z-score mean? A negative z-score means the x value is below the mean. This means that the weight is below average. What does a positive z-score mean? A positive z-score means the x value is above the mean. This means that the weight is above average. What is the most negative z-score you think we will find? What is the most positive z-score? Typically, values in a normal distribution rarely fall outside two or three standard deviations from the mean. For data derived from chance, we probably won\u2019t see any values that are less than -3 or greater than +3. Ask students: \u201cWhere does a baby that weighs 100 ounces fall within the distribution of baby weights?\u201d Have students find 100 ounces on the x-axis of the normal curve and draw a vertical line from the x-axis until it intersects the normal curve. Have them shade the area under the curve to the left of the vertical line. Tell students that the shaded area represents a percentile in the distribution. A percentile is the exact value in which the desired proportion of observations lies below the specific value in a distribution. Use RStudio to calculate the percentile. pnorm(100, mean = 119.6, sd = 18.2) = 0.140 Doctors report percentiles to describe a child's development compared to other children their age. For a baby that weighs 100 ounces, a doctor would report the following: \u201cThe baby is at the 14th percentile in weight.\u201d This means that the baby weighs more than 14% of all babies. Note: A z-score can also be used to calculate a percentile, but since a z-score is a standardized score, the mean of the distribution would be zero and the standard deviation would be one. pnorm(-1.08, mean = 0, sd = 1) = 0.140 Inform the class that they will be using RStudio during the next few days to practice using normal models.

Students will keep for use in subsequent lessons. Mr. Jones Mile Run Times handout ( LMR_2.3_Mr. Jones Run Times ) Vocabulary: measures of central tendency (or center) typical measures of variability (or spread) mean average balancing point Essential Concepts: Essential Concepts: The center of a distribution is the 'typical' value. One way of measuring the center is with the mean, which finds the balancing point of the distribution. The mean gives us the typical value, but does not tell the whole story. We need a way to measure the variability to understand how observations might differ from the typical value. Lesson: In student pairs, ask students to discuss what they think the following terms mean: Measures of central tendency. A value that shows the tendency of quantitative data to gather around a central, or typical , value. Also known as measures of center . Students will learn about two such measures: the mean and the median. Measures of variability. Values that show how much the quantitative data varies. Also known as measures of spread . Note: This is not taught during this lesson, but will be addressed as part of Lesson 4 . Ask a pair to share what they think these two terms mean. Pairs who are listening must decide whether they agree or disagree with the pair that shared. Lead a discussion based on their statements of agreement or disagreement. Communicate to the class that they will be learning more about these measures and what they tell us about data as we progress through this unit. By a show of hands, ask students how many are familiar with finding the mean , or average . Select a student to share his/her process for finding the mean. Possible answer: Add up all of the numbers. Then divide by how many numbers there are. Another way to find the mean is to find the balancing point of a distribution. They will learn about the balancing point via the activity in Steps 7 & 8. Distribute the Pennies on a Ruler handout ( LMR_2.2 ) along with a marker, ruler, tape, and 6 pennies to each table group. If you prefer to not print the document, you can project it on the board instead. LMR_2.2 Guide the students through the handout and have them share their findings throughout the activity. Be sure to emphasize the idea that the mean of a distribution can be identified by finding its balancing point. Next, distribute the class\u2019s Personality Color survey data to the students. Have student pairs find the variable Blue (whether or not that was their predominant color) in the class\u2019s printed data. As a class, make a dot plot on the board to show the distribution of Blue values. Each student should come to the board and draw a dot to indicate where their value is in the distribution. Ask the students: What do you think the typical Blue score is? Answers will vary by class. They should be driven to an answer in the center of the distribution. Are the data roughly symmetric? Where is the balancing point of this distribution? Answers will vary by class. Once a value is chosen, indicate the location on the dot plots. As a class, compute the mean Blue score for the entire class on the board and compare this value to the class\u2019s prediction of the balancing point. Students may not remember exactly how to compute the mean, so you can remind them of the general algorithm or refer them back to their responses from Step 5 above. Show the students the formula for calculating the mean: Now that they have calculated the mean for the Blue score, ask them to identify each symbol in the formula with a step in their algorithm for finding the mean, and discuss the meaning of the symbols in the formula as a class. x i represents each individual data point and n represents the total number of observations. Indicate the location of the calculated mean on the dot plots by drawing a vertical line at the value on the x-axis. Ask student pairs to engage in a conversation about how close the mean value is to their predicted balancing point and why their prediction was made that way. Select a pair to share their discussion with the whole class. Using the Personality Color survey data from Step 9, ask student pairs to compute the mean score for each of the other three personality colors. Inform the students that, during the next lesson , they will learn about another method that can be used for measuring the center of a distribution. Now, you can inform the class about an even easier method of calculating the mean \u2013 using RStudio! Explain that the command RStudio uses to calculate the mean incorporates the algorithm of summing up all the data and dividing by the total number of observations. Students will be able to use this command for quick calculations now. Note: If you have already \u201c Exported , Uploaded , Imported \u201d the class\u2019s Personality Color campaign data, you can simply use the exact command below to calculate the mean Blue score: > mean(~blue, data = colors) In general, the function can be denoted as follows: > mean(~variable, data = datafile) So, for our specific example, blue is the variable we want to find the mean value of, and colors is the datafile . Have the students Think-Pair-Share to discuss how the mean value of a group of data could be used to easily describe complicated things. For example, instead of giving someone the entire class\u2019s Blue scores, we could just tell him/her the mean score and he/she would have a general idea about the class.

A value that shows the tendency of quantitative data to gather around a central, or typical , value. Also known as measures of center . Students will learn about two such measures: the mean and the median. Measures of variability. Values that show how much the quantitative data varies. Also known as measures of spread . Note: This is not taught during this lesson, but will be addressed as part of Lesson 4 . Ask a pair to share what they think these two terms mean. Pairs who are listening must decide whether they agree or disagree with the pair that shared. Lead a discussion based on their statements of agreement or disagreement. Communicate to the class that they will be learning more about these measures and what they tell us about data as we progress through this unit. By a show of hands, ask students how many are familiar with finding the mean , or average . Select a student to share his/her process for finding the mean. Possible answer: Add up all of the numbers. Then divide by how many numbers there are. Another way to find the mean is to find the balancing point of a distribution. They will learn about the balancing point via the activity in Steps 7 & 8. Distribute the Pennies on a Ruler handout ( LMR_2.2 ) along with a marker, ruler, tape, and 6 pennies to each table group. If you prefer to not print the document, you can project it on the board instead. LMR_2.2 Guide the students through the handout and have them share their findings throughout the activity. Be sure to emphasize the idea that the mean of a distribution can be identified by finding its balancing point. Next, distribute the class\u2019s Personality Color survey data to the students. Have student pairs find the variable Blue (whether or not that was their predominant color) in the class\u2019s printed data. As a class, make a dot plot on the board to show the distribution of Blue values. Each student should come to the board and draw a dot to indicate where their value is in the distribution. Ask the students: What do you think the typical Blue score is? Answers will vary by class. They should be driven to an answer in the center of the distribution. Are the data roughly symmetric? Where is the balancing point of this distribution? Answers will vary by class. Once a value is chosen, indicate the location on the dot plots. As a class, compute the mean Blue score for the entire class on the board and compare this value to the class\u2019s prediction of the balancing point. Students may not remember exactly how to compute the mean, so you can remind them of the general algorithm or refer them back to their responses from Step 5 above. Show the students the formula for calculating the mean: Now that they have calculated the mean for the Blue score, ask them to identify each symbol in the formula with a step in their algorithm for finding the mean, and discuss the meaning of the symbols in the formula as a class. x i represents each individual data point and n represents the total number of observations. Indicate the location of the calculated mean on the dot plots by drawing a vertical line at the value on the x-axis. Ask student pairs to engage in a conversation about how close the mean value is to their predicted balancing point and why their prediction was made that way. Select a pair to share their discussion with the whole class. Using the Personality Color survey data from Step 9, ask student pairs to compute the mean score for each of the other three personality colors. Inform the students that, during the next lesson , they will learn about another method that can be used for measuring the center of a distribution. Now, you can inform the class about an even easier method of calculating the mean \u2013 using RStudio! Explain that the command RStudio uses to calculate the mean incorporates the algorithm of summing up all the data and dividing by the total number of observations. Students will be able to use this command for quick calculations now.

Have the students Think-Pair-Share to discuss how the mean value of a group of data could be used to easily describe complicated things.

The median is preferred for skewed distributions or when there are outliers because it better matches what we think of as 'typical.' Lesson: Remind students that, during the previous lesson, they learned about the mean as the balancing point of a distribution and as a measure of center. In statistics, there are a few values that can be considered as measures of center \u2013 the mean is one, and another is the median . The median is the middle value in a group of ordered observations. As a simple example, write or display the following group of numbers on the board: 8, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4, 9, 5, 5 Since there are 9 numbers in the list above, we should use the 5 th number as the median because it is directly in the middle and there are 4 numbers above it, and 4 numbers below it. However, students should realize that they cannot simply pick the middle number of the list as it is currently written (this would give a median value of 7). Instead, they must first arrange the numbers in numerical order (from lowest to highest). 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 Now they can identify that the true median value of this list of numbers is 5. Next, randomly distribute one sticky note to each student. Advanced preparation required: There should be one card for every student in the class. All of the cards, except one, need to have the value 0 written on them. One card should have the value 1,000,000 written on it. Place poster paper on the board and have the students create a dot plot by placing their sticky notes at the corresponding values on the axis. Then, ask and record answers to the following questions: What is the typical value of these data? 0 \u2013 all sticky notes but one have a value of 0. Using the formula we learned in class, calculate the mean, or average, value of this distribution. Answer will vary by class/class size. Example: for a class with 28 students enrolled, there would be 27 values of 0 and 1 value of 1,000,000. Therefore, the mean value would be (0*27 + 1,000,000)/28 \u2248 35,714.3. Does the mean you calculated match your understanding of \u201ctypical?\u201d Why is the mean not capturing our notion of \u201ctypical?\u201d The 1,000,000 value is heavily skewing the calculation of the mean. It is pulling the mean to a higher value than what we consider to be typical for these data. Since we introduced the idea of the median as a measure of center at the beginning of class, have the students find the median value of the data on their sticky notes. If time permits, have them place the sticky notes in a line across the board in order (from least to greatest) and have them find the middle number. The median value will be 0. Ask students why there is such a large difference between the mean and median values even though they are both measures of center? Is there a specific reason why the mean is larger than the median for this particular set of data? In this case, there was an outlier value that skewed the distribution and forced the balancing point to move to the right. Display the first 2 plots in the Medians \u2013 Dotplots or Histograms ? file ( LMR_2.4 ). They are labeled as plots for discussion for the beginning of class. Both the dotplot and histogram depict the number of candies eaten by a group of 17 high school students. LMR_2.4 For the first 2 plots, ask students: Which plot makes it easier to find the median number of candies eaten \u2013 the dot plot or the histogram? Why? The dot plot is easier because we can simply find the middle dot and record the value. It is harder on the histogram, because we would have to add up the amount in each bar to find the middle person. What is the median value? The median number of candies eaten is 1 candy. Inform the students that they will practice finding medians of distributions using the Where is the Middle? handout ( LMR_2.5 ). They will be determining medians when distributions have different shapes (e.g., symmetric, left-skewed, right-skewed). Distribute the Where is the Middle? handout ( LMR_2.5 ). Students should complete the handout individually first, then compare answers with their team members. Once each team has agreed upon their answers, discuss the handout as a class. LMR_2.5 Ask the following questions to elicit a team discussion about the relationship between means and medians: What did you notice about the relationship between the mean and median values for the symmetric distributions? The mean and median values in the symmetric distributions - plots (a) and (d) - are fairly similar. For plot (a), the mean and median are exactly equal. For plot (d), the mean is actually larger than the median, but not by much (2.29 > 2). What did you notice about the relationship between the mean and median values for the left-skewed distributions? The mean value was smaller than the median value in both of the left-skewed distributions - plots (c) and (f). Both plots had the same values for the mean (2.53) and the median (3.00) - clearly, the mean is much smaller than the median (2.53 < 3). What did you notice about the relationship between the mean and median values for the right-skewed distributions? The mean value was larger than the median value in both of the right-skewed distributions - plots (b) and (e). For plot (b), the mean was only slightly higher than the median (1.18 > 1). For plot (e), the mean was a decent amount higher than the median (0.47 > 0). Steer the discussion towards the relationship between the shape of a distribution and its corresponding mean and median values. Is there a pattern that emerges between the mean and median values for differently shaped distributions? Yes! It seems that symmetric distributions will produce similar mean and median values, left-skewed distributions will produce smaller means and higher medians, and right-skewed distributions will produce higher means and smaller medians. For each of the plots in the Where is the Middle? handout ( LMR_2.5 ), which value better matches your idea of \u201ctypical\u201d for that specific distribution? For plot (a), both the mean and median agree and appear to be the balancing point of the distribution \u2013 both match what we think is typical. For plot (b), the median seems to be more typical, but the values are very close. For plot (c), the median appears to be a more typical value. For plot (d), both the mean and median appear to be capturing our idea of typical. For plot (e), the median is a better match to typical. For plot (f), the median is also a better match. Steer the discussion so that students recognize that the better measures of center for skewed distributions are typically medians, and the better measures for center for symmetric distributions are typically means. Display the last 2 plots in the Medians \u2013 Dotplots or Histograms file ( LMR_2.4 ). They are labeled as plots for discussion for the end of class. Both the dot plot and histogram depict the number of candies eaten by a group of 330 high school students. For the last 2 plots, ask students: Which plot makes it easier to find the median number of candies eaten \u2013 the dot plot or the histogram? Why? The histogram is easier because we can estimate based on the distribution\u2019s shape. There are too many dots in the dot plot to find the exact middle person. What is the median value? The median number of candies eaten is 7 candies. Class Scribes: One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.

Objective: Students will understand that the mean of the absolute deviations (MAD) is a way to assess the degree of variation in the data from the mean and adjusts for differences in the number of points in the data set ( n ). The MAD measures the total distance between all the data values from the mean and divides it by the number of observations in the data set.

More precisely, the MAD is the typical distance of observations from the mean. There are other measures of spread as well, notably the standard deviation and the interquartile range (IQR). Lesson: Remind students that they learned about 2 different measures of center during the previous 2 lessons: the mean and the median. Have the students recall when it is appropriate to use each value based on the shape of the distribution. Mean \u2013 use with symmetric distributions. Median \u2013 use with skewed distributions or when there are outliers. Inform the students that, during today\u2019s lesson, they will learn about measures of variability \u2013 also known as measures of spread . These values show us how much the quantitative data varies from the center of a distribution. Similar to measures of center, we will use two different measures of spread: (1) the mean of absolute deviations (MAD), and (2) the interquartile range (IQR). Note: IQR will be discussed in detail during Lesson 5 . Introduce the term deviation . Using Think , Pair , Share , ask students what they think this word means and how it could relate to variability. A deviation is the act of departing from an established course or accepted standard. Common synonyms include departure, detour, difference, digression, divergence, fluctuation, inconsistency, modification, shift, etc. On the classroom floor next to each student team, place a 4-5 foot long piece of masking tape (or painter\u2019s tape). Then, propose the following scenario: Your team has been invited to guest star at the circus! You have been asked to perform as part of the tightrope act \u2013 a routine that requires tremendous focus and balance to walk across a tightly pulled rope that is suspended high in the air. In order to practice your balancing skills, the circus has provided your team with a line of tape that will represent the tightrope. Have the students consider the piece of tape (aka the rope) to be the \u201ctypical\u201d path they must take to finish the circus act. Since they do not want to fall from the suspended tightrope while performing at the actual circus, they will need to practice walking directly on the middle of the line at all times. If they deviate from the line, they will no longer be walking the \u201ctypical\u201d path, and will likely fall. Each team should select one student to be their starting performer. In teams of 4, one student is the performer, two are measuring the distance of the deviation (one on each side of the tape), and one is the recorder. Place a ruler perpendicular to the \u201crope\u201d and measure the distance, in centimeters, from the path to the center of the back of their heel as the student walks and attempts to balance across the \u201crope.\u201d The performer will walk the tightrope by looking straight up to the sky \u2013 first they look to place a foot on the line, then walk naturally while looking up to the sky, and repeating one step at a time for 4 steps, measuring after each step. Any time the performer missteps, this is considered a variation from the typical value. You can have students take turns so everyone gets a chance to balance, walk, and to measure, depending on time in your class. Now that the students have an idea about what it means to deviate from something they consider \u201ctypical,\u201d they can start looking at distributions to see how data points vary from their typical value. Inform students that they were observing deviations from typical while calculating actual differences between the rope and the performer\u2019s steps. When data are quantified with numbers, we can then calculate how far away each value is from the center. One such calculation that is popular among data scientists is the mean of absolute deviations (MAD). Ask students to consider the components of the MAD in math terms, and brainstorm what the MAD value might represent. mean \u2013 an average absolute \u2013 in mathematics, we talk about absolute value, the positive difference between 2 numerical values deviation \u2013 as discussed earlier in the lesson, deviation represents how much things vary Using the 3 components in Step 12, explain that the MAD measures the absolute distance of each data point from the mean, and then finds the average of all those distances. Display the formula for the MAD distribution for the whole class to see. Discuss what each symbol in the formula means and how we use it to perform the calculation. x i represents each individual data point, x\u0304 represents the mean value, and n represents the total number of observations. The symbol \u03a3 represents the summation \u2013 this tells us to add up all the absolute distances from each point to the mean. To practice using this formula with actual data, students will calculate and compare the MAD values for 2 distributions. Distribute the How Far Apart? handout ( LMR_2.6 ), which contains 2 of the dot plots - plots (a) and (c) from the Where is the Middle? handout ( LMR_2.5 ) used in Lesson 3 . As before, the dot plots depict the number of candies eaten by a group of 17 high school students on different days of the week. The means are also given. LMR_2.6 The calculations for each plot are shown below for the teacher\u2019s reference. MAD for plot (a) MAD for plot (c) Students may work in pairs to complete the handout. After all student pairs have come to an agreement on their answers, pose the following questions to the class as a whole: Which MAD value did you think would be larger based only on the look/shape of the distributions? Why? Since plot (c) is skewed to the left, it probably has a larger MAD because more points will be further away from the mean than in plot (a). Which MAD value was actually larger when you calculated it? The MAD value for plot (c) was larger (1.1418 > 0.8253). Did your prediction match the actual calculated values, or were you surprised by the results? Yes. The distribution with the wider spread (more variability) had the larger MAD value. To continue exploring with the class\u2019s Personality Color survey data, student teams should calculate the MAD value for their Blue scores. Does the MAD value seem reasonable based on the dot plot they created during Lesson 2 ? Class Scribes: One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.

Have the students recall when it is appropriate to use each value based on the shape of the distribution. Mean \u2013 use with symmetric distributions. Median \u2013 use with skewed distributions or when there are outliers. Inform the students that, during today\u2019s lesson, they will learn about measures of variability \u2013 also known as measures of spread . These values show us how much the quantitative data varies from the center of a distribution. Similar to measures of center, we will use two different measures of spread: (1) the mean of absolute deviations (MAD), and (2) the interquartile range (IQR). Note: IQR will be discussed in detail during Lesson 5 . Introduce the term deviation . Using Think , Pair , Share , ask students what they think this word means and how it could relate to variability. A deviation is the act of departing from an established course or accepted standard. Common synonyms include departure, detour, difference, digression, divergence, fluctuation, inconsistency, modification, shift, etc. On the classroom floor next to each student team, place a 4-5 foot long piece of masking tape (or painter\u2019s tape). Then, propose the following scenario: Your team has been invited to guest star at the circus! You have been asked to perform as part of the tightrope act \u2013 a routine that requires tremendous focus and balance to walk across a tightly pulled rope that is suspended high in the air. In order to practice your balancing skills, the circus has provided your team with a line of tape that will represent the tightrope. Have the students consider the piece of tape (aka the rope) to be the \u201ctypical\u201d path they must take to finish the circus act. Since they do not want to fall from the suspended tightrope while performing at the actual circus, they will need to practice walking directly on the middle of the line at all times. If they deviate from the line, they will no longer be walking the \u201ctypical\u201d path, and will likely fall. Each team should select one student to be their starting performer. In teams of 4, one student is the performer, two are measuring the distance of the deviation (one on each side of the tape), and one is the recorder. Place a ruler perpendicular to the \u201crope\u201d and measure the distance, in centimeters, from the path to the center of the back of their heel as the student walks and attempts to balance across the \u201crope.\u201d The performer will walk the tightrope by looking straight up to the sky \u2013 first they look to place a foot on the line, then walk naturally while looking up to the sky, and repeating one step at a time for 4 steps, measuring after each step. Any time the performer missteps, this is considered a variation from the typical value. You can have students take turns so everyone gets a chance to balance, walk, and to measure, depending on time in your class. Now that the students have an idea about what it means to deviate from something they consider \u201ctypical,\u201d they can start looking at distributions to see how data points vary from their typical value. Inform students that they were observing deviations from typical while calculating actual differences between the rope and the performer\u2019s steps. When data are quantified with numbers, we can then calculate how far away each value is from the center. One such calculation that is popular among data scientists is the mean of absolute deviations (MAD). Ask students to consider the components of the MAD in math terms, and brainstorm what the MAD value might represent. mean \u2013 an average absolute \u2013 in mathematics, we talk about absolute value, the positive difference between 2 numerical values deviation \u2013 as discussed earlier in the lesson, deviation represents how much things vary Using the 3 components in Step 12, explain that the MAD measures the absolute distance of each data point from the mean, and then finds the average of all those distances. Display the formula for the MAD distribution for the whole class to see. Discuss what each symbol in the formula means and how we use it to perform the calculation. x i represents each individual data point, x\u0304 represents the mean value, and n represents the total number of observations. The symbol \u03a3 represents the summation \u2013 this tells us to add up all the absolute distances from each point to the mean. To practice using this formula with actual data, students will calculate and compare the MAD values for 2 distributions. Distribute the How Far Apart? handout ( LMR_2.6 ), which contains 2 of the dot plots - plots (a) and (c) from the Where is the Middle? handout ( LMR_2.5 ) used in Lesson 3 . As before, the dot plots depict the number of candies eaten by a group of 17 high school students on different days of the week. The means are also given. LMR_2.6 The calculations for each plot are shown below for the teacher\u2019s reference. MAD for plot (a) MAD for plot (c) Students may work in pairs to complete the handout. After all student pairs have come to an agreement on their answers, pose the following questions to the class as a whole: Which MAD value did you think would be larger based only on the look/shape of the distributions? Why? Since plot (c) is skewed to the left, it probably has a larger MAD because more points will be further away from the mean than in plot (a). Which MAD value was actually larger when you calculated it? The MAD value for plot (c) was larger (1.1418 > 0.8253). Did your prediction match the actual calculated values, or were you surprised by the results? Yes. The distribution with the wider spread (more variability) had the larger MAD value. To continue exploring with the class\u2019s Personality Color survey data, student teams should calculate the MAD value for their Blue scores. Does the MAD value seem reasonable based on the dot plot they created during Lesson 2 ?","title":"Lesson:"},{"location":"unit2/lesson4/#class-scribes","text":"One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.","title":"Class Scribes:"},{"location":"unit2/lesson4/#homework-next-day","text":"Students should calculate the MAD values for each of the other 3 personality color scores and compare the values of the 4 color scores.

They will learn how to compute and interpret another measure of spread: the IQR.

One approach is to compare the centers, spreads, and shapes of the distributions. Boxplots are a useful way of comparing distributions from different groups when all of the distributions are unimodal (one hump). Lesson: Remind students that we have been using the following numerical and graphical summaries to look at data: Measures of center \u2013 mean, median Measures of spread \u2013 MAD Graphing \u2013 dotPlots, histograms Explain that all of these tools help us describe data to someone who may not actually be viewing it. Today, we will explore another way to summarize and describe data to others with the use of another type of statistical plot that involves breaking data up into distinct pieces: a boxplot . For the next activity, students will need to carry their DS journals and a pen with them. Instruct students to stand up and move their chairs away from the longest wall in the classroom. Ask them to line up against the wall (in no particular order). Note: If there isn\u2019t enough room for everyone to line up together inside the classroom, you may do this activity outside along a building wall. Say, \u201cI want to know which person represents the typical height of students in our class. Can I tell by looking at the line as it currently stands? How would I be able to tell?\u201d Students should discuss with a partner. Ask students to share their discussions. Call on students to contribute to what has been shared if needed. Guide students to see that organizing the data (in other words, themselves) can give you a visual for their heights. Then tell them to line up in height order from shortest to tallest along the wall. Once students are arranged (and this may take a little time\u2014allow students to develop their own algorithm for finding the ordering), ask them how they might be able to describe their distribution of heights. Possible answers include: mean, median, MAD. Ask them to split themselves into two groups, one half that is taller and one half that is shorter, and have them decide which student represents the class\u2019s median height. Have the median student stand next to the wall directly in front of the poster paper. Advanced preparation required: Before class begins, tape a piece of poster paper, approximately 3-4 feet long, vertically to a wall in the classroom. The students will be creating a plot using lines drawn at certain students\u2019 heights. Draw a horizontal line on the poster paper to mark the location of the median by having the actual student stand in front of the poster paper so you can mark his/her exact height. Be sure to label this point as the median and include the student\u2019s actual height, in inches. Next, ask the two halves to split again, so there are now four groups of students. The breaks between each group are called quartiles because they break the data into four groups ( quartile comes from the Latin word quartus , which is also the root of the Spanish word cuatro ). The lower break represents the first quartile (because 25% of the class is shorter than this student\u2019s height), and the upper break represents the third quartile (because 75% of the class is shorter than this height). Another term that can be used in place of percentiles is quantiles because they represent the quantity of data that is lower than that value. Using the student who represents the first quartile, draw another horizontal line on the poster paper marking his/her height. The student should stand in the same spot as the student who represented the median so that the line for this student is drawn underneath the median line. Be sure to label this point as the first quartile (or Q 1 ) and include the student\u2019s actual height, in inches. Using the student who represents the third quartile, draw another horizontal line on the poster paper marking his/her height. The student should stand in the same spot as the student who represented the median so that the line for this student is drawn above the median line. Be sure to label this point as the third quartile (or Q 3 ) and include the student\u2019s actual height, in inches. Finally, ask the tallest and shortest student to stand in front of the poster paper and draw horizontal lines at their heights. The shortest person represents the minimum height of the students in the class, and the tallest person represents the maximum height. Be sure to label the points as the minimum and maximum, and include the students\u2019 actual heights, in inches. When you finish, you should have five lines, which represent the five-number summary : minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum. Draw a box using the first and third quartiles as the edges of the box. The median line will be contained within the box. Extend a line from the first quartile down to the minimum and extend a line from the third quartile up to the maximum. Your class\u2019s boxplot should look similar to the following: Students should now be facing the newly created boxplot. Allow students time to sketch the boxplot in their DS journals, with the appropriate labels. Ask students: What is the difference between the largest and smallest heights? Is there a large difference between the tallest and shortest person? Students should calculate maximum \u2013 minimum. Inform students that this difference is known as the range of the data set. What is the difference between the quartiles Q 1 and Q 3 ? What percent of our class falls within these two values? Students should calculate Q 3 \u2013 Q 1 . 50% of the class falls between these two height values. Inform students that this difference is known as the interquartile range (or IQR) . Remind students that they learned about one measure of spread (the MAD) during the previous lesson, and tell them that we now have another measure of spread \u2013 the IQR. Pose the following questions to the students: What does it mean when the IQR is small? The middle 50% of heights are close to each other. What does it mean when the IQR is large? The middle 50% of heights are more spread out. Finally, subset the class into introverts and extroverts. Ask each group of students (the introverts and extroverts) to create a boxplot of their group\u2019s heights on a piece of poster paper using the techniques they just learned as a class. Ask each group to share their boxplot with the class. Lead a discussion about the similarities and differences between the plots, and be sure to include how they compare to the overall combined boxplot of heights they created earlier. In the discussion, have the students calculate the IQR for both plots and make a comparison by asking: What does the IQR tell us about each group? Answers will vary by class.

Ask students: What other representations of distributions have we seen? Answers may include: dotPlots, bar charts, scatterplots, histograms, and tables. Distribute the From Dotplots to Boxplots handout ( LMR_2.11 ). In teams, students will sketch boxplots from dotplots.

LMR_2.12 Inform students that they are now going to gather in their teams and practice matching different representations of distributions. Each group will receive 15 plots (5 dotPlots, 5 histograms, and 5 boxplots). Their task is to determine which dotplots, histograms, and boxplots represent the same data. Once each group has decided upon their 5 groupings, engage the students in a class share out until all students agree. Then, have the students record their responses to the following statements and/or questions in their DS journals: What types of data are best for using a histogram? Histograms are useful for almost any type of data. They can easily show the shape of a distribution (including skewness and multiple peaks). They are usually best with larger data sets. What types of data are best for using a dotplot? Dotplots can also easily show the shape of a distribution. They are preferred over histograms when there is a relatively small amount of data. What types of data are best for using a boxplot? Boxplots are useful when the distribution has one mode (one peak). They are also useful to describe data that are heavily skewed or that contain outliers. Describe some characteristics of data that become hidden when a boxplot is used instead of a dotplot or histogram. Dotplots and histograms can show the number of modes in a distribution, but a boxplot cannot. If a distribution is bimodal, we will not be able to tell in a boxplot.

Objective: Students will understand the basic rules of probability. They will learn that previous outcomes do not give information about future outcomes if the events are independent.

Probability measures a long-run proportion: 50% chance means the event happens 50% of the time if you repeated it forever . When we don't repeat forever, we see variability. Lesson: Ask students to consider possible synonyms for the word chance . If someone says, \u201cThat just happened by chance,\u201d what does that mean? Synonyms: possibility, prospect, expectation, unintentional, unplanned. The actual definition of chance is \u201ca possibility of something happening.\u201d Then, ask them which game \u2013 chess or the board game, \u201cSorry\u201d \u2013 is more based on chance. Why? Note: Any game can be chosen. \"Sorry\" is more based on chance because many outcomes are determined by dice rolls. In chess there are certain strategies and movements that can be planned, so it is more a game of skill. For \"Sorry\" the players roll a die (number cube), so the numbers they roll have an impact on how well they do in the game. Next ask students if they can think of situations where chance is the only force at play. Possible responses: card games, slot machines, the lottery, coin flipping, and rock-paper-scissors. Play the \u201cHeads\u201d video from the movie Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbInZ5oJ0bc . In their IDS Journals, ask students to write down their initial reactions to the clip by responding to the following questions: Is it possible to get 78 heads in a row when tossing a coin? Yes, it is possible to get 78 heads in a row since one coin toss does not determine the next coin toss. Do you think it is likely to get 78 heads in a row? No, although it is possible to get 78 heads in a row. How many times should we get heads when tossing a coin? 1 out of 2 times, or 50% of the time. On average, how many times out of the 78 tosses should the characters have gotten heads? Roughly 39 times. Ask students to discuss their findings with their team members and come to an agreement on their responses. Afterwards, conduct a Whip Around and ask each team to share its findings. Are there any differences between the teams? Any similarities? As teams share their responses, students should add to or revise their individual findings in their IDS Journals. Explain to students that, from the concept of chance, we can start learning about probability . Chance is simply the possibility that something will happen, and probability is a measurement for how often something happens in the \u201clong run.\u201d Students may have ideas about how to calculate probabilities based on prior classes or knowledge, but inform them that IDS will be taking a different approach by using simulations (see next step). Since we don\u2019t want to actually flip a coin 78 times like the actors did in the video, we can have RStudio simulate them for us. A simulation is a way of creating random events that are close to real-life situations without actually doing them. It is a kind of model , which is a way of representing real-world situations so that predictions can be made. Explain to students that R has a function that does coin flipping for us, and that it assumes an equal probability of heads and tails. Using a projector to display your computer screen to the whole class, demonstrate how to do one simulation of a coin flip in RStudio. Use the following function: > rflip(1) Explain that the value of 1 in the argument part of the function tells R to flip the coin 1 time. If we want to flip the coin 10 times, we could simply change the function to rflip(10) . Run the function again using 10 as the number of times to flip the coin. Ask students: How many heads (\u201cH\u201ds) were there? Answers will vary for each sample. How many Tails (\u201cT\u201ds) were there? Answers will vary for each sample. In the output, what does Flipping 10 coins [Prob(Heads) = 0.5] mean? This is RStudio telling us that we are tossing the coin 10 times and that the probability of getting heads is 0.5 because it is a fair coin. In the output, what does Number of Heads: 3 [Proportion Heads: 0.3] mean? Note: This is an example of an output. Your sample may have a different value for the number of heads that appeared, and therefore a different value for the proportion of heads. This is RStudio telling us that in our sample, we got heads 3 out of the 10 times we flipped the coin. The sample proportion is automatically calculated for us by dividing the number of heads by the total number of tosses (in this case, 3/10 = 0.3). To relate back to the video at the beginning of class, repeat the simulation once more, but use 78 as the number of coin flips rflip(78) . Ask students: How many heads (\u201cH\u201ds) were there? Since we know to expect about 39 heads if the coin is fair, does the value seem reasonable? Answers will vary for each sample. Most likely, you will see values near 39. How many Tails (\u201cT\u201ds) were there? Answers will vary for each sample. What proportion of the coin flips were heads? Answers will vary for each sample. Using the rflip(78) command, run the simulation 3-5 more times and have students record the values for the number of heads and the proportion of heads. As an example, we ran the function 3 times and saw the following values: Sample 1 \u2013 amount of heads: 45 proportion of heads: 0.577 Sample 2 \u2013 amount of heads: 33 proportion of heads: 0.423 Sample 3 \u2013 amount of heads: 42 proportion of heads: 0.538 Have students answer the questions below. The important thing to note is that the values can and (almost always) WILL change each time you run the simulation to create a new sample. How do the proportions of heads in the samples compare to each other? Answers will vary. How do the proportions of heads compare to the true probability of heads (1/2 or 50%)? Answers will vary, but students should notice that most of the probabilities are close to 50%. Why is there a 50% chance of getting heads during each coin flip? Since there are two sides to a coin, both should be equally likely to come up. So there is a 1 out of 2 chance of getting heads and 1 out of 2 chance of getting tails. Ask students to engage in a discussion with their group about the statement below, then have a few group reporters share out. If a coin was flipped 78 times, I would claim that the coin is unfair if I got less than # heads or more than # heads. Inform students that you are going to perform 500 simulations. Each simulation represents a coin being flipped 78 times. For each simulation, the computer will record the number of heads in the 78 flips. A histogram will be created that represents the number of heads in each of the simulations. The histogram is a model that will display what typically happens when a fair coin is flipped 78 times. Copy and paste the code below in an RScript and run each line of code, one at a time, for the students: set.seed(11) #reproducibility flips <- do(500)*rflip(78) View(flips) # 4 variables histogram(~heads, data = flips) favstats(~heads, data = flips) Engage the students in a discussion about the histogram: What is this distribution telling us? When flipping a fair coin 78 times, what typically happened was that it landed on heads between 36 and 40 times (36/78 = 0.46 to 40/78 = 0.51). It was not uncommon for the coin to land on heads 31-35 (0.40-0.45) times or 41-45 (0.52-0.58) times. Even landing on heads between 46-50 (0.59-0.64) times was not too uncommon. What was very uncommon, however, was landing on heads less than 30 times (less than 38%) or more than 51 times (more than 65%). Were your group's cut-offs (item #16) similar to what the chance model displayed? Answers will vary. Some groups' intervals might be very wide and others very narrow. Using the chance model (histogram) which displays what typically happens when a fair coin is flipped 78 times, make a call for the scenarios below - fair or unfair? You flip a coin 78 times and get 37 heads. Fair. 37 was very common based on the histogram. You flip a coin 78 times and get 46 heads. Fair. 46 was less common but not too uncommon. You flip a coin 78 times and get 20 heads. Unfair. In the 500 simulations not once did we see a FAIR coin land on heads 20 times. Next pose the following question: If you get a heads on the first toss of a coin, will you definitely get a heads on the next toss? Will you definitely get a tails on the next toss? No. One coin toss should not affect another coin toss. Each time you flip the coin, the chances of getting heads versus tails remains the same. Introduce the concept of independence . Explain that, when tossing a fair coin, there is no relationship between each toss. The second toss does NOT depend on the first toss; therefore, the coin tosses are independent of each other. Class Scribes: One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.

Collect the Tweets and select a few to share with the class. Of the Tweets shared, ask students which one is closest to the definition: probability measures how often something happens in the \u201clong run.\u201d Remind students that, during the previous lesson, they were introduced to simulations. The progression following this path: chance \u2192 probability \u2192 simulations. The motivation for using simulations is that we can use the calculated sample proportions to estimate probabilities of reallife events. During today\u2019s lesson, we will be continuing to learn about probability and simulations to determine if an event is not fair (one example: a coin is weighted and lands on heads more often than tails). Ask students what they know about dice (number cubes). If they have never heard of them, show one to the class and explain how it works. A die (number cube) is a 6-sided cube. Each face of the cube is labeled with dots to represent a number between 1 and 6. For example, if the face has 3 dots, then it represents the number 3. The cube itself is weighted so that there is an equal probability of rolling each of the 6 numbers. Have a discussion about what the students would expect the probability of rolling the number 1 should be if a die (number cube) were tossed into the air and allowed to fall back to the ground (or table). Since there are 6 numbers on the die, each number should be equally likely to occur, so the probability of rolling a 1 is 1/6. Display a piece of poster paper on the board with columns labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Explain that each column represents the numbers on the die (number cube). We will be using poster to tally the results of actual dice (number cube) rolls. Select two students to be dice (number cube) rollers and give each student one die. As noted in the Materials section above, you can have the students use either regular hard dice, or softer foam ones (can be found at dollar stores). Tell the class that each student roller will be rolling the dice 6 times (so there will be a total of 12 rolls for our sample). Ask: If they are rolling the dice 6 times, how often do you think Student 1 will roll a 3? Would you expect it to be the same for Student 2? Out of 6 rolls, we would expect to see each of the numbers one time, so we will most likely see about one 3 for Student 1. Would you expect the Student 2 to roll a 3 just as often? Why? Yes, we should expect the same thing from Student 2 because we have independent events. There are actually two ways that independence plays a part here: (1) each student is independent from the other and has no effect on what the other will roll, (2) the 6 die rolls for Student 1 are all independent of each other because each face of the cube has an equal chance of happening on any given roll. So, if Student 1 gets a 3 during his/her first roll, that doesn\u2019t give us any information about what he/she will get on the second roll. Since we will have 12 rolls (and therefore 12 samples), how many tally marks should we expect in each column on the chart? We would expect to see 2 tally marks in each column (each number will probably be rolled twice). Have each student roller toss his/her die one time and share the outcomes with the rest of the class. As they do this, place a tally mark in the corresponding column on the chart. Repeat this process 5 more times so that each student has a total of 6 rolls. As a class, observe the results in the chart and discuss the following: Do the data from these 12 rolls match what we expected (see responses from Step 8)? Is this surprising? Answers will vary by class. Some values may have shown up more than we expected (example: the number 3 was rolled 3 times), and others may not have been rolled at all (example: the number 5 was never an outcome). We only have a small sample of data, so it\u2019s not surprising for our results to vary from the expected outcomes. If the data do not match our expectations, does this mean the dice are unfair in some way? Even if they don\u2019t match our expectations, this does not mean the dice are unfair \u2013 we simply don\u2019t have enough data yet to know. We would need to roll the dice more. If we wanted to purposely create an unfair die, what are some ways we could achieve that? Answers will vary by class. Some examples include: (1) We could add tape to one face of the die to give that side more weight. This would increase the chances of the number that is directly opposite of it appearing because the die will land on the heavier side more (and therefore the side facing up will be the number opposite). (2) We could chip the edge of one corner of the die. This would throw off the original balance and favor certain sides. Similar to the previous day\u2019s lesson with coin flipping, we can also simulate dice rolls in RStudio. The function required is called roll_die() . The arguments for this function are a bit different than the rflip() function from yesterday. We cannot simply put roll_die(1) for the computer to roll a die one time. Instead, the function was built with 2 possible dice to choose from \u2013 die A and die B. Inform the students that one of the dice in the function is fair and the other has been created with bias . Bias is the act of favoring one outcome over another. They will attempt to determine which dice is the biased one by doing multiple simulations. Note to Teacher: Many simulations require multiple functions, or code, to perform. This is where RScripts are helpful. An RScript can be used to test code, write notes, and let us easily execute multiple lines of code at one time. This would be a good place to introduce students to RScripts. Using a projector to display your computer screen to the whole class, demonstrate how to open an RScript. Type the following function on your script and click Run. Run simply pastes the function onto the console. roll_die(\u201cA\u201d, times = 1) The output will show one number that represents what value on the die the computer rolled. Go back to your script and modify the function to roll die A 12 times. roll_die(\u201cA\u201d, times = 12) Compare the results of these 12 simulated rolls to the results of the 12 actual rolls completed by the two students during Step 9. If there is space available on the tally chart, you can add the computer results to it for an easy comparison. Ask students how we could record data from these simulations if we wanted to roll the die 100 times. Would they want to hand count the number of times each value occurred? Is there a function in RStudio that will count them for us? It would be difficult to count every individual value in the output on the screen. However, we can use the tally() function to find out how many times each die value appeared. To make using the tally() function easier, we should assign a name to each simulation so we don\u2019t have to type the entire function multiple times. We can also have it calculate the proportions for each value. Add the functions below to your RScript and run them one at a time. sample1 <- roll_die(\u201cA\u201d, times = 100) tally(sample1) tally(sample1, format = \u201cproportion\u201d) Remind the students that if the die is fair, then each side of the die should appear roughly the same amount of times. Therefore, the proportions should be fairly similar to each other and to the true probability of 1/6. Add the function below to your script, but before running it, ask the students what they think a histogram of the simulated data might look like and then run the command on your screen. Note: Be sure to include the argument nint = 6 so that the resulting histogram has six bars. If the die is fair, each of the bars in the histogram should be roughly the same height. histogram(sample1, nint = 6) Note to teacher: Show students how to save an RScript. Inform students that they can take notes on their RScript by including a hashtag (also known as a pound sign or #) at the beginning of the note. Data scientists refer to these types of notes as \u201ccode comments\u201d or simply \u201ccomments\u201d. See image below. The Script will be stored in the files tab. To run each function individually, place your cursor on the line and click the Run button. To run multiple lines of code at once, highlight them and click Run. Allow the students to access their school computers now to start creating their own simulations in an RScript using die B. Students can pair up, if needed. Have them begin by asking RStudio to roll the die 100 times. They should note their output from both the tally() function and the histogram. They can then compare the results to those from Step 14. Are they similar? Can they determine which die is unfair yet? Answers will vary by class. The results will be similar, but not exact. With the sample sizes of each simulation being fairly small, we cannot see a clear difference between the two dice yet. Let the students explore by changing the number of times RStudio rolls the dice. Remind them that the goal is to determine which of the two dice is biased. The sample sizes need to be very large in order for them to see a clear difference between the 2 histograms. The pattern becomes more visible when times = 2000 . Note: The maximum value for times within the roll_die() command is 500. Simulations can be combined using the concatenate function c() . For example, suppose s1 represents 500 rolls of die A and s2 is a second sample of 500 rolls for die A. To combine these two samples the following can be used more_rolls <- c(s1, s2) When students have had enough time to make a decision regarding which dice is biased and how, engage the class in a discussion to verify that everyone agrees. Die B is biased; Die A is fair. Die B favors the number 3. Then, steer the conversation towards why the sample size affected the results. The sample size needed to be large because the difference between the probabilities of the die rolls was very small. In order to detect small differences, we must have larger sample sizes. Class Scribes: One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were. Homework Students will consider a four-sided die and imagine rolling it 20 times. They should sketch a histogram of (a) the ideal, expected outcome, (b) an outcome that they think is \u201crealistic,\u201d and (c) an outcome they might see if the die were biased to produce more 4\u2019s.","title":"Lesson 9: Bias Detective"},{"location":"unit2/lesson9/#lesson-9-bias-detective","text":"","title":"Lesson 9: Bias Detective"},{"location":"unit2/lesson9/#objective","text":"Students will learn how to use simulations to detect biased probability.","title":"Objective:"},{"location":"unit2/lesson9/#materials","text":"Poster paper \u2013 with 6 columns labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 2 dice (number cubes) Note: You can use regular hard dice, or soft foam dice (can be found at dollar stores) Projector for RStudio functions","title":"Materials:"},{"location":"unit2/lesson9/#vocabulary","text":"bias","title":"Vocabulary:"},{"location":"unit2/lesson9/#essential-concepts","text":"Essential Concepts: In the short-term, actual outcomes of chance experiments vary from what is 'ideal.'

The progression following this path: chance \u2192 probability \u2192 simulations. The motivation for using simulations is that we can use the calculated sample proportions to estimate probabilities of reallife events. During today\u2019s lesson, we will be continuing to learn about probability and simulations to determine if an event is not fair (one example: a coin is weighted and lands on heads more often than tails). Ask students what they know about dice (number cubes). If they have never heard of them, show one to the class and explain how it works. A die (number cube) is a 6-sided cube. Each face of the cube is labeled with dots to represent a number between 1 and 6. For example, if the face has 3 dots, then it represents the number 3. The cube itself is weighted so that there is an equal probability of rolling each of the 6 numbers. Have a discussion about what the students would expect the probability of rolling the number 1 should be if a die (number cube) were tossed into the air and allowed to fall back to the ground (or table). Since there are 6 numbers on the die, each number should be equally likely to occur, so the probability of rolling a 1 is 1/6.

A short article about tuberculosis facts can be found at: http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/factsheets/general/tb.htm Since this is an experiment, answer the following questions below. You may need to research the answer to some of the questions. a. What is the research question? b. Who are the subjects that participated in the experiment? c. What is the treatment? d. Who is in the treatment group? e. Who is in the control group? f. How were the subjects assigned to each group? g. What population is this experiment representative of? h. What is the variable that we will be measuring? i. What is the outcome of this experiment? To answer your research question, you and a partner will compare the outcome of the data with the outcomes given by a chance model (in which Streptomycin has no effect on TB). First, scrape the data. Refer to the web scraping lab if you need to recall how to scrape data. To access Sir Hill\u2019s data, go to: https://labs.idsucla.org/extras/webdata/tb.html Second, determine the percentages of subjects in the study that died and the percentages of the subjects that recovered for each group. Third, assuming that the treatment had no effect, use the data to: a. Calculate the percentage of people with tuberculosis we would expect to die. b. Use the expected percentage for (a), above, to calculate the number of people we expect to die from the treatment group. c. Compare the percentage from (b) to the percentage from the treatment group actually died. Then, if we assume that the outcome does not depend on the treatment, design and complete an appropriate simulation in RStudio using a chance model to replicate Sir Hill\u2019s study: a. Shuffle the treatment and control labels 300 times; each time, calculate the percentage of treatment patients who \u201cdied\u201d. Plot the distribution of the 300 percentages. Refer to the simulation labs if you need to recall how to create a simulation. b. Use the results from the chance model (shuffling) to determine whether (i.) or (ii.) below is the most reasonable explanation for the actual data in Sir Hill\u2019s study and state why: i. Streptomycin is a much better treatment for tuberculosis than bed rest. So, the outcome depends on the treatment. ii. The actual difference between treatments is due to chance; Streptomycin may not be effective on tuberculosis. So, it is possible that treatment and outcome are independent. Can we say that Streptomycin causes the recovery of tuberculosis patients? Explain your answer. Create a 4-5 slide, 5-minute presentation that shows your results. Be sure to include a detailed explanation of how you and your partner decided to conduct your simulation. Each person must participate in the presentation. In addition to the presentation, submit a 2-4 page, double-spaced summary of your analysis.","title":"End of Unit Project: TB or Not TB"},{"location":"unit3/end/#end-of-unit-project-and-oral-presentation-tb-or-not-tb","text":"","title":"End of Unit Project and Oral Presentation: TB or Not TB?"},{"location":"unit3/end/#objective","text":"Students will apply what they have learned in the unit.","title":"Objective:"},{"location":"unit3/end/#materials","text":"Computers IDS Unit 3 \u2013 Project and Oral Presentation ( LMR_U3_End of Unit Project ) IDS Unit 3 \u2013 End of Unit Project TB or Not TB Experiments in the medical field that involve new treatments (new medications) are called clinical trials.

In science, we need to closely examine the quality of evidence in order to make sound conclusions. Anecdotes can contain personal bias, might be carefully selected to represent a particular point of view, and, in general, may be completely different from the general trend. Lesson 2: What is an Experiment? Science is often concerned with the question \"What causes things to happen?\". To answer this, controlled experiments are required. Controlled experiments have several key features: (1) there is a treatment variable and a response variable, and we wish to see if the treatment causes a change that we can measure with the response variable; (2) There is a comparison/control group; (3) Subjects are assigned randomly to treatment or control (randomized assignment); (4) Subjects are not aware of which group they are in (a 'blind'). This may require the use of a placebo for those in the control group; and (5) those who measure the response variable do not know which group the subjects were in (if both 4 and 5 are satisfied, this is a 'double blind' experiment). Lesson 3: Let\u2019s Try an Experiment! Randomized assignment is required to determine cause-and-effect. Lesson 4: Predictions, Predictions Designing an experiment requires making many decisions, including what to measure and how to measure it. Lesson 5: Time Perception Experiment Designing and carrying out an experiment helps us answer specific statistical questions of interest. Lesson 6: Observational Studies Observational studies are those for which there is no intervention applied by researchers. Lesson 7: Observational Studies vs. Experiments Experiments are not always possible because of various factors such as ethics, cost limitations, and feasibility. Lesson 8: Monsters that Hide in Observational Studies Confounding factors/variables make it difficult to determine a cause-and-effect relation between two variables. Lesson 9: Survey Says\u2026 Surveys ask simple, straightforward questions in order to collect data that can be used to answer statistical questions. Writing such questions can be hard (but fun)! Lesson 10: We\u2019re So Random Another popular data collection method involves collecting data from a random sample of people or objects. Percentages based on random samples tend to \u2018center\u2019 on the population parameter value. Lesson 11: The Gettysburg Address Statistics vary from sample to sample. If the typical value across many samples is equal to the population parameter, the statistic is 'unbiased.' Bias means that we tend to \u201cmiss the mark.\u201d If we don't do random sampling, we can get biased estimates. Lesson 12: Bias in Survey Sampling Bias concerning survey sampling includes identifying sampling methods that may lead to biased samples, recognizing potential over- or under-representation in samples, and acquiring skills to choose more reliable sampling techniques. Lesson 13: The Confidence Game There is uncertainty when we estimate population parameters. Because of this, it is better to give a range of plausible values, rather than a single value. Lesson 14: How Confident Are You? The margin of error expresses our uncertainty in an estimate. The estimate, plus or minus the margin of error, gives us an interval in which we are very confident the true value lies. Lesson 15 Ready, Sense, Go! Sensors are another data collection method. Unlike what we have seen so far, sensors do not involve humans (much). They collect data according to an algorithm. Lesson 16: Does it have a Trigger? A key feature that distinguishes the way sensors collect data from more traditional approaches is that sensors collect data when a 'trigger' event occurs. In Participatory Sensing, this event is something we humans agree upon beforehand. Every time that trigger happens, we collect data. Lesson 17: Creating Our Own Participatory Sensing Campaign Creating a Participatory Sensing Campaign requires that survey questions must be completed whenever they are \u201ctriggered\u201d. Research questions provide an overall direction in a Participatory Sensing Campaign. Lesson 18: Evaluating Our Own Participatory Sensing Campaign Statistical investigative questions guide a Participatory Sensing Campaign so that we can learn about a community or ourselves. These Campaigns should be evaluated before implementing to make sure they are reasonable and ethically sound. Lesson 19: Implementing Our Own Participatory Sensing Campaign Practicing data collection prior to implementation allows optimization of a Participatory Sensing Campaign. Lesson 20: Online Data-ing Stretching the conception of data involves seeing that many web pages present information that can be turned into data. Lesson 21: Learning to Love XML XML is a programming language that we use with our campaigns. We create basic XML \"tags\" in the code, which help us store data in a format we understand. Lesson 22: Changing Orientation Converting XML to spreadsheet format helps us better understand and view our data.","title":"Essential Concepts"},{"location":"unit3/essential/#ids-unit-3-essential-concepts","text":"","title":"IDS Unit 3: Essential Concepts"},{"location":"unit3/essential/#lesson-1-anecdotes-vs-data","text":"Data beat anecdotes.

Learning by sampling In many circumstances, there's simply no feasible way to gather data about everyone in a population . \u2013 For example, the Department of Water & Power (DWP) wants to determine how much water people in Los Angeles use to take a shower. They've created a survey to pass out to collect this information. \u2013 Write down two reasons why getting everyone in Los Angeles to fill out the survey would be difficult. Also, write a sentence why the DWP might consider using a sample of households instead. In this lab, we'll learn how sampling methods affect how representative a sample is of a population . Loading a population In previous labs, we used the cdc data as a sample for young people in the United States. \u2013 In this lab, we'll consider these survey respondents to be our population. Load the cdc data into R and fill in the blanks to take a convenience sample of the first 50 people in the data: s1 <- slice(____, 1:____) Why do you think we call this method a convenience sample? Comparing your convenience sample A convenience sample is a sample from a population where we collect data on subjects because they're easy-to-find. Using your convenience sample, create a bargraph for the number of people in each grade . \u2013 Do you think the distribution of grade for your sample would look similar when compared to the whole cdc data? \u2013 Which groups of people do you think are over or under represented in your convenience sample?

Directions: Follow along with the slides, completing the questions in blue on your computer, and answering the questions in red in your journal. Confidence and intervals Throughout the year, we've seen that: \u2013 Means are used for describing the typical value in a sample or population, but we usually don't know what they are, because we can't see the entire population. \u2013 Means of samples can be used to estimate means of populations. \u2013 By including a margin of error with our estimate, we create an interval that increases our confidence that we've located the correct value of the population mean. Today, we'll learn how we can calculate margins of error by using a method called the bootstrap . \u2013 Which comes from the phrase, Picking yourself up by your own bootstraps . In this lab Load the built-in atus ( American Time Use Survey ) dataset, which is a survey of how a sample of Americans spent their day. \u2013 The United States has an estimated population of 327,350,075. How many people were surveyed for this particular dataset? The statistical question we wish to investigate is: What is the mean age of people older than 15 living in the United States? Why is it important that the ATUS is a random sample? Use our atus data to calculate an estimate for the average age of people older than 15 living in the U.S. One bootstrap A bootstrapped sample is when we take a random sample() of our original data ( atus ) WITH replacement. \u2013 The size of the sample should be the same size as the original data. We can create a single bootstrapped sample for the mean in three steps: `1. Sample the number of the rows to use in our bootstrap . `2. slice those rows from our original data into our bootstrap data. `3. Calculate the mean of our bootstrapped data. Our first bootstrap Fill in the blanks to sample the row numbers we'll use in our bootstrapped sample. \u2013 Be sure to re-read what a bootstrapped sample is from the previous slide to help you fill in the blanks. \u2013 Use set.seed(123) before taking the sample. bs_rows <- ____(1:____, size = ____, replace = ____) Use the slice function to create a new dataset that includes each row from our sample . bs_atus <- slice(atus, bs_rows) Take a look Look at the values of bs_rows and bs_atus .

Lesson: Prepare your video player to show the first 5 minutes and 23 seconds of Hans Rosling\u2019s video How Not to Be Ignorant About the World found at: https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_and_ola_rosling_how_not_to_be_ignorant_about_the_world Ask students to play along as they watch the video. Each time Hans Rosling asks the audience to choose an answer to each of the three questions, pause the video for about 5 seconds and ask students to write down what they think is the answer to each question. After viewing the video, engage students in T-I-P-S (see strategies) with the questions below: Why did the chimps at the zoo score better than the people? Answer: Anyone can select the correct answer just by chance. On the second question, Hans Rosling says that \u201ceveryone is aware that there are countries and there are areas where girls have great difficulties and they are stopped when they go to school.\u201d How could this information influence the answer choice? Answer: Personal knowledge and experiences can influence what we think we know. Why do you think only a few people know the correct answer to these three questions? Answer: People do not know enough about the data that can help them answer these questions. Display the following statements to students: \u201cMy skin glows more\u2026I feel pretty confident.\u201d Melissa for Proactiv\u00ae \u201cWithin four months, I'd lost a grand total of 63 pounds* and was down to my goal weight.\u201d Marianne G. for Nutrisystem\u00ae \u201cThe customer service is obnoxious. The employees are patronizing, smug, and intractable.\u201d Seymour773 for Bank of America\u00ae Discuss each statement with students by asking the following questions: Is a good product? For example, is Proactiv\u00ae a good skin product?, is Nutrisystem\u00ae a good diet program?, is Bank of America\u00ae a good bank? Do you think this person\u2019s experience is \u201ctypical?\u201d Why? Maybe it is typical but maybe not. Their own experience might be very different. Do you think the company chose this person? How do you know? Each company may have chosen the first 2 statements because they were a success. In the case of the Seymour773, a competing company may have chosen his experience to make them appear better. What about all the other people? How many were successes, how many failures? We don\u2019t know for sure. How could we answer such questions? Collect data! Inform students that the statements are called testimonials and they are examples of anecdotes . Anecdotes are stories that someone tells about his/her own experience or the experience of someone he/she knows. Anecdotes are good for some things like witness statements in a police report but are not useful for reaching conclusions about groups of people because the assumptions they are based on are not always true. Their claims are easily debunked. Many anecdotes do not equal data. Note to teacher about witness statements: Lots of evidence suggests that witness testimony needs to be examined very closely. \"As perhaps the single most effective method of proving the elements of a crime, eyewitness testimony has been vital to the trial process for centuries. However, the reliability of eyewitness testimony has recently come into question with the work of organizations such as The Innocence Project, which works to exonerate the wrongfully convicted. This thesis examines previous experiments concerning eyewitness testimony as well as court cases in which eyewitnesses provided vital evidence in order to determine the reliability of eyewitness testimony as well as to determine mitigating or exacerbating factors contributing to a lack of reliability.\" Information gathered from digitalcommons.liberty.edu On the other hand, data are a series of observations, measurements, or facts. Data are information and tell a story. Quickly survey students about whether the video they watched at the beginning of class is based on anecdotes or data. Then inform students that they will analyze two articles to find out if their claims are based on anecdotes or data.

Materials: Populations & Samples handout ( LMR_3.5_Populations and Samples ) RStudio Projector for RStudio functions Dotplot titled \u201cPercent of Students Who Have Met Friends Online\u201d Parameters & Statistics handout ( LMR_3.6_Parameters and Statistics ) Vocabulary: population sample representative sample random sample parameter statistic Essential Concepts: Essential Concepts: Another popular data collection method involves collecting data from a random sample of people or objects. Percentages based on random samples tend to \u2018center\u2019 on the population parameter value. Lesson: Introduce today\u2019s lesson by displaying the following statement made by the Pew Research Center in their August 2015 report titled Teens, Technology & Friendships : \u201cFor today\u2019s teens, friendships can start digitally: 57% of teens have met new friends online. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.7 percentage points. Social media and online gameplay are the most common digital venues for meeting friends.\u201d Note: The data for this report were collected via interviews of 1,060 teenagers between the ages of 13 and 17. Discuss the results of the Pew poll with the following prompting questions: The report says that 57% of teens have met new friends online. Since the report was based on a sample of 1,060 teens, how many of the teens reported that they have met friends online? 0.57(1060) = 604.2. This means that approximately 604 teens in the sample have met friends online. Do you think 57% of students in our class have met friends online? Why or why not? Answers will vary by class. The discussion should include points about how similar and different samples can be. The sample of students in the Pew poll may not represent the students in our class. What percent of students in our class have met friends online while a teenager? Answers will vary by class. Calculate the percentage by dividing the number of students who have met friends online by the total number of students who came to class today. What if [absent person] were in class today? Would that change our percentage? What effect would it have on the percentage if [absent person] answered \u201cyes?\u201d What effect would it have if [absent person] answered \u201cno?\u201d Answers will vary by class. If a student who was absent for today\u2019s lesson had actually come to class, we would have a different sample of students. It would change the percentage because our sample size now includes 1 more person. If the person answered \u201cyes,\u201d the values in the numerator and denominator of the percentage would change. If the person answered \u201cno,\u201d the value in the denominator would change. (Students should calculate these values.) If we were able to interview every single teenager in the United States, would exactly 57% of them say they have met friends online? Probably not because there are many more teenagers in the US than the 1,060 they interviewed. It would be unlikely for a group of 1,060 teenagers to exactly represent all teenagers in the entire country. Why do you think the Pew Research Center only interviewed 1,060 teenagers, and not all teenagers in the US? It would be impossible to talk to all teenagers in the US in a short period of time, or even a fairly long period of time. Introduce students to the terms population and sample . Explain that a population consists of all of the people we want to learn something about. A sample consists of people (or objects) that are selected from the population. In pairs, ask students to discuss and record answers to the following two questions: What was the population of interest to the researchers for the Pew poll above? All teenagers in the US right now. Based on your answer in (a), what characteristics should people have in order to be included in a sample for this poll? People would need to be in the US and be between the ages of 13 and 17. People could be from many states, but we would not want to sample only people from California, or only people from Los Angeles. It would be impossible to survey every single person in the US; this is why we create a random representative sample of the population. Note: Steer the discussion so that students see that a sample has to be \u201clike\u201d or \u201csimilar to\u201d or \u201crepresentative of\u201d the population. Select pairs to share their responses to the questions and let students revise their responses. Distribute the Populations & Samples handout ( LMR_3.5 ), which contains survey results from other Pew Research Center reports. Give students time to determine the population and sample for each scenario, and then have them verify their results with a partner. LMR_3.5 State that we want to know the percentage of students in our class that have made friends online, but we don\u2019t want to ask every single student. Instead, we would like to ask only 10 students and then make some guesses about our class from those 10. Ask: What is the population of interest? The students in our classroom. How can we select 10 students to be part of our sample? Answers will vary by class. There may be a variety of suggestions; here are some examples of what may be given: (1) put every student\u2019s name in a hat and pick out 10; (2) select the 10 students sitting closest to the teacher\u2019s desk; (3) have 10 students volunteer to be in the sample. Inform students that, in general, we want samples to \u201clook like\u201d the population. One way to get a representative sample like this is to take a random sample . Ask the students: Would the selection techniques we came up with in Step 6 result in random samples of our class. Answers will vary by class. Using the examples from Step 6: (1) putting each student\u2019s name in a hat and then picking out 10 would be a random sample as long as each piece of paper is the same size; (2) selecting the 10 students sitting closest to the teacher\u2019s desk would not be a random sample because those students might not represent the whole class; (3) if 10 students volunteer, we would not have a random sample because those students selected themselves to be part of the group and may not represent everyone in the class. Next, assign each student in the class a number by having them count off from 1 to N ( N being the total number of students in the class). Show students that we can use RStudio to create random samples with the following function: > sample(1:N, size = 10, replace = FALSE) Note: we use replace = FALSE because we only want each student to be selected once. Using the results given in the output of RStudio, ask the students whose numbers were chosen to stand. Inform them that they are \u201cin\u201d the sample. Then, determine what percent of the sample (these 10 students) have made friends online. How does this percentage compare to the overall class percentage we found in Step 2(c)? Answers will vary by class. Create a dotplot on the board titled \u201cPercent of Students Who Have Met Friends Online.\u201d Record the sample percentage from Step 9 on this dotplot. Have the students return to their seats so that we can select a new sample. Before we do this, ask: What do you predict the percentage to be for the next sample of 10 students? Answers will vary by class. They might say the expected percentage will be close to the class\u2019s overall percentage. Using RStudio, create a new sample, calculate the percentage of those 10 students who have met friends online, and record the value in the dotplot. Repeat Step 11 for a few more rounds (at least 5 samples should be taken). Be sure that the students give a prediction before finding each new sample. Display the following questions. Refer to the dotplot of sample percentages. Ask students to discuss the questions in teams: What do you notice about the sample percentages? What is the \u201ctypical\u201d value? Answers will vary by class. The typical value should be close to the class\u2019s overall percent calculated in Step 2(c) since it is the population percent. What is the smallest value? What is the biggest value? Answers will vary by class. There might be a lot of variability in the dotplot based on the selected samples. Most sample percentages will be within 30% of the population value, so that really gives a wide variety of possible sample values. If we took a larger sample \u2013 maybe of size 15 or 20 \u2013 would there be more or less variability in the dotplot? There will be less variability because adding more people gets us closer to the population size. Be sure to point out that if the sample were exactly the same as the population, then there would be no variability in the plot. Select teams at random to share their responses to the questions above with the whole class. The rest of the teams should be in full agreement with the responses before moving on to the next question. Explain that the population percentage (the percentage of all students in the class who met friends online) we have been using is called a parameter . A parameter is any number that summarizes a population. So, our class has been the population, and the percentage of students that have met friends online is the parameter. Similarly, the term statistics is used for numbers that summarize a sample. Ask students what sample statistics they have seen today? Each value we included in the dotplot is a statistic. Be sure to point out that there can be multiple values for a sample statistic (i.e. \u201cWe had 5 sample percentages in our dotplot.\u201d), but there is always only one parameter value. Using these new definitions, ask students to consider the original Pew poll data, which found that 57% of teens have met friends online. Ask the students: Is 57% a parameter or statistic? This is a statistic because it is based on a sample. Remind them that the population was ALL US teenagers and the sample included 1,060 teens. What is the population parameter then? We don\u2019t know! We would have to interview every teenager in the US to determine the parameter, and that is not possible. Conclude the lesson by telling the students: although we cannot determine the actual population parameter for the percent of teens that have made friends online, we can estimate it using random samples.

Then, determine what percent of the sample (these 10 students) have made friends online. How does this percentage compare to the overall class percentage we found in Step 2(c)? Answers will vary by class. Create a dotplot on the board titled \u201cPercent of Students Who Have Met Friends Online.\u201d Record the sample percentage from Step 9 on this dotplot. Have the students return to their seats so that we can select a new sample. Before we do this, ask: What do you predict the percentage to be for the next sample of 10 students? Answers will vary by class. They might say the expected percentage will be close to the class\u2019s overall percentage. Using RStudio, create a new sample, calculate the percentage of those 10 students who have met friends online, and record the value in the dotplot. Repeat Step 11 for a few more rounds (at least 5 samples should be taken). Be sure that the students give a prediction before finding each new sample. Display the following questions. Refer to the dotplot of sample percentages. Ask students to discuss the questions in teams: What do you notice about the sample percentages? What is the \u201ctypical\u201d value? Answers will vary by class. The typical value should be close to the class\u2019s overall percent calculated in Step 2(c) since it is the population percent. What is the smallest value? What is the biggest value? Answers will vary by class. There might be a lot of variability in the dotplot based on the selected samples. Most sample percentages will be within 30% of the population value, so that really gives a wide variety of possible sample values. If we took a larger sample \u2013 maybe of size 15 or 20 \u2013 would there be more or less variability in the dotplot? There will be less variability because adding more people gets us closer to the population size. Be sure to point out that if the sample were exactly the same as the population, then there would be no variability in the plot. Select teams at random to share their responses to the questions above with the whole class. The rest of the teams should be in full agreement with the responses before moving on to the next question. Explain that the population percentage (the percentage of all students in the class who met friends online) we have been using is called a parameter . A parameter is any number that summarizes a population. So, our class has been the population, and the percentage of students that have met friends online is the parameter. Similarly, the term statistics is used for numbers that summarize a sample. Ask students what sample statistics they have seen today? Each value we included in the dotplot is a statistic. Be sure to point out that there can be multiple values for a sample statistic (i.e. \u201cWe had 5 sample percentages in our dotplot.\u201d), but there is always only one parameter value. Using these new definitions, ask students to consider the original Pew poll data, which found that 57% of teens have met friends online. Ask the students: Is 57% a parameter or statistic? This is a statistic because it is based on a sample. Remind them that the population was ALL US teenagers and the sample included 1,060 teens. What is the population parameter then? We don\u2019t know! We would have to interview every teenager in the US to determine the parameter, and that is not possible. Conclude the lesson by telling the students: although we cannot determine the actual population parameter for the percent of teens that have made friends online, we can estimate it using random samples.","title":"Lesson:"},{"location":"unit3/lesson10/#class-scribes","text":"One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.","title":"Class Scribes:"},{"location":"unit3/lesson10/#homework","text":"Students should complete the Parameters & Statistics handout ( LMR_3.6Q LMR_3.6 ) for homework.

Vocabulary: sampling bias Essential Concepts: Essential Concepts: Statistics vary from sample to sample. If the typical value across many samples is equal to the population parameter, the statistic is 'unbiased.' Bias means that we tend to \u201cmiss the mark.\u201d If we don't do random sampling, we can get biased estimates. Lesson: Introduce the lesson by describing the Gettysburg Address: President Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address in November 1863. It is one of the most famous speeches in the United States. In it, Lincoln invoked the principles of human equality contained in the U.S. Constitution and Declaration of Independence. Read the Gettysburg Address aloud to the class OR have students read it aloud. The text of the speech can be found in the Gettysburg Address handout ( LMR_3.7 ). LMR_3.7 Today we will use the Gettysburg Address to learn about different sampling techniques. Inform students that the Gettysburg Address contains 272 words. We can consider these 272 words to be our population because it includes all words in the entire speech. From the population, we can sample 10 words that we think represent the speech. It is ok for this step to be vague \u2013 students can come up with their own concept for what they think \u201crepresentative\u201d means in this case. Distribute the Sampling the Gettysburg Address handout ( LMR_3.8 ), which includes the actual speech, as well as 2 sampling activities. For this part of the lesson, we will only be looking at Sampling Activity 1 on page 1 of the handout. Note: This activity was originally created by Allan Rossman and Beth Chance, and has been modified for the IDS curriculum. LMR_3.8 Inform students that they will get 30 seconds to select 10 words that they think are representative of all words in the speech. This is our first sampling plan. Note: It is important that students work fast so they are forced to choose based on first impressions and don't have time to reflect. Also, this activity tends to not work well if students are informed of the punch line (that random samples are unbiased) before they begin. At this point, explain to students that we are actually interested in answering a specific question: What is the typical word length in the Gettysburg Address? Next, students should record each circled word, as well as the number of letters each word has (this is the word length) in the table on the handout. Then, they should summarize the data in a dotplot and calculate the mean word length of the sample. On the board, create a class dotplot (may also be done on poster paper) titled \u201cMean Word Length, Self-Selected Sample, Size = 10.\u201d Once all students have completed the first page of the Gettysburg Address handout ( LMR_3.8 ), ask each student to record the mean word length of his or her sample on the class\u2019s dotplot. When all students have recorded their sample statistics in the dotplot, conduct a class discussion based on the questions listed below. Note: You might need to do a reality check. Students will often make mistakes when adding the word lengths and when dividing. Be suspicious (and double-check) extreme values. What does each point on the plot represent? Each point represents one student's estimate of the mean length of all of words in the Gettysburg address. What is the typical value represented in the dotplot? Answers will vary by class. You should indicate the approximate location of the mean of the distribution (the balancing point, on the dotplot. Remind students that when we ask for the 'typical' value we mean the value in the center of the distribution. How much variability is there in the distribution? Answers will vary by class. One reasonable approach is for students to give the range (the difference between the largest and smallest values). What is the shape of the distribution? Answers will vary by class. Often, the shape is right-skewed, but it might not be for you. Note that outliers here will often be arithmetic errors, but not always. Next, display the histogram from the Gettysburg Address \u2013 Word Length Histogram file ( LMR_3.9 ), which shows the distribution of word lengths for the entire population of words in the Gettysburg Address. LMR_3.9 Remind students that the population is the 272 words from the speech, and inform them that the mean word length of the population, or the population parameter, is 4.22. Using Think-Pair-Share , ask: How does the typical value of our class\u2019s sample means compare to the actual population mean of 4.22? Almost always, the class\u2019s typical mean will be higher (sometimes much higher) than 4.22. Some students will be close to 4.22. But point out that we are talking about the \"trend\" or typical outcome. The typical outcome is usually too high. Explain that our sampling plan was a self-selected sample, which often produces biased results. Sampling bias occurs when the resulting samples tend to produce results that are influenced in one particular direction. Note: Bias is NOT the same as prejudice. Bias is a tendency to lean towards a certain belief or viewpoint, and is mostly unconscious. Prejudice is a very conscious phenomenon though, where a person actively makes a decision to dislike something based on unfounded facts. Refer back to the dotplot of sample means and point out how it is biased. Ask: Why was our original sampling procedure biased? When we look for 'representative' words, and do so quickly, our eyes are drawn by the larger, more unusual words, and we tend to overlook small words such as \u201cin,\u201d \u201ca,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d etc. Go back to the Gettysburg Address handout ( LMR_3.8 ), and direct students to page 2 for Sampling Activity 2. Inform students that they will now do a sampling procedure that results in a better representation of the population of words in the speech. Explain that a random sample tends to produce unbiased sample results. Before students begin the activity, demonstrate how to generate 10 random numbers from a possible 272 using RStudio. > sample((1:272), size = 10, replace = FALSE) Each student should generate his or her own set of 10 random numbers. Once students have created their random numbers, distribute the Gettysburg Address Word Lengths handout ( LMR_3.10 ). LMR_3.10 Explain that the table contains the word number, word, and length of each word in the Gettysburg Address. Demonstrate how to find a word that corresponds to one of the random numbers generated by RStudio, and explain that this word is now part of our random sample. Then, each student will complete the handout by creating a dotplot and calculating the mean of their random sample. On the board, near the first dotplot, create another class dotplot (may also be done on poster paper) titled \u201cMean Word Length, Random Sample, Size = 10.\u201d Once all students have completed the second page of the Gettysburg Address handout ( LMR_3.8 ), ask each student to record the mean word length of his or her random sample on the class\u2019s dotplot. Note: As in Step 9, be sure to check arithmetic for outliers! When all students have recorded their sample statistics in the dotplot, conduct a class discussion based on the following questions: What does each point in the dotplot represent? Each dot represents one student's estimate of the mean word length. But this time, the estimates are based on a random sample of 10 words. What do you notice about the typical value in this distribution? Answers will vary by class. They should notice that the means of the random samples are fairly close to the population mean of 4.22. (Again, you might have to discard or correct outliers.) What shape does this distribution have? What does that tell us? Typically, the distribution of sample means for random samples will be symmetric and unimodal. What does this distribution tell us about the benefits of random samples? We can reduce bias by collecting random samples instead of self-selected samples. Why do we need sampling? Why can\u2019t we just get the information from the actual population? It is usually impossible to include every person or object from a population. Even for the population of size 272 words in the Gettysburg Address, it would take a long time to calculate the word lengths of every single word. Conclusions and takeaways: It turns out that there are approximately 5.17\u202210 17 different possible samples of 10 words from the Gettysburg Address. If we could determine the mean for each of these samples and produce a dotplot for all of these means, then the center of the dotplot would lie exactly at 4.22. And while on the subject of characteristics, like center, the shape of the dotplot is symmetric and unimodal. The resulting distribution of the means from all possible samples is called the sampling distribution for the sample mean (for samples of size 10 from this population). The above dotplot is an approximation to the actual sampling distribution. Class Scribes: One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were. Homework & Next Day Students should write a reflection about why random sampling is better at reducing bias than other sampling procedures.

Materials: Identifying Biased Samples handout ( LMR_3.11_Identifying Biased Samples ) Poster paper Vocabulary: survey sample over-represented under-represented random sampling Essential Concepts: Essential Concepts: Bias concerning survey sampling includes identifying sampling methods that may lead to biased samples, recognizing potential over- or under-representation in samples, and acquiring skills to choose more reliable sampling techniques. Lesson: Remind students that they learned about biased samples during the last few lessons. Today, they will continue with this topic and discuss how people are selected to be in a sample. The people who are asked to participate in a survey are known as the survey sample . Ideally, the people who are included in the survey sample are a representative group of the target population, or the population we would like to make inferences about. Propose the following scenario to the class: \u201cAn elementary school is going to start serving ice cream in the cafeteria every Friday during lunch, and needs to know the favorite flavor of its students.\" In pairs, ask students to come up with two examples of samples that might be biased. For instance, one biased sample might include only the four 3 rd grade classes at the school. For each biased sample, the students should answer the following questions in their DS journals: Who is the target population? All students at the elementary school. Who is included in your biased sample? Only 3 rd grade students. These students are overrepresented in the sample. Who is not included in your biased sample? All other students in the school (Kindergartners, 1 st , 2 nd , 4 th , and 5 th graders). These students are underrepresented in the sample. Is your sample representative of the target population? No! We\u2019re only including 3 rd graders, and they may not have the same preferences as other students. Once pairs have come up with their biased samples and answered the questions in Step 4, they should share out with their student teams and answer the following questions: How is your biased sample different from the samples created by other pairs in your team? Answers will vary by class. An example might be that one pair sampled only 3 rd graders and the other pair sampled only girls. Which do you think is more representative of the target population? Why? Answers will vary by class. Using the example above, we could argue that either one is more representative. We could maybe say that, since 3 rd graders include both boys and girls, we have a more representative sample than if we just sampled girls. Or, we could say that since girls come from all grade levels, they\u2019re more representative of the entire school than just 3 rd graders. After the teams have discussed their samples, they should select one pair\u2019s biased sample to share with the rest of the class. Record each team\u2019s biased sample on a sheet of poster paper with the following layout: Biased Sample Who is overrepresented? Who is underrepresented? All 3 rd grade students 3 rd grade students All other students (kindergartners, 1 st , 2 nd , 4 th , and 5 th graders) Distribute the Identifying Biased Samples handout ( LMR_3.11 ). In this activity, students will explain why a particular sampling method might result in a biased sample \u2013 a sample that is not representative of the population of interest. Note: It is NOT enough for students to say that the \u201csample is not random.\u201d They need to explain how the sample is biased. Note: Page 2 of the handout provides sample answers for teacher reference ONLY. Do NOT distribute page 2 to students. LMR_3.11Q LMR_3.11 Each student should complete the handout independently. Afterwards, conduct a whole-class discussion to compare and contrast different students\u2019 explanations of how the samples might be biased. For each example given in the handout, discuss who is most likely over-represented and who is most likely under-represented in the sample. Ask the students: Now that we have learned about sampling biases, how can we eliminate this type of bias? Answers will vary by class. Note: Allow students to collaborate and come up with a few ideas on their own of how to eliminate sampling bias. If desired, ideas can be written on the board for discussion and comparison. Conclude with the actual answer: random sampling . If we randomly sample people from our population of interest, we can reduce the bias of any sample statistics obtained from the survey responses. If we have a biased sample, we can only give descriptions about that particular sample; we CANNOT generalize to the population of interest.

All 3 rd grade students 3 rd grade students All other students (kindergartners, 1 st , 2 nd , 4 th , and 5 th graders) Distribute the Identifying Biased Samples handout ( LMR_3.11 ). In this activity, students will explain why a particular sampling method might result in a biased sample \u2013 a sample that is not representative of the population of interest. Note: It is NOT enough for students to say that the \u201csample is not random.\u201d They need to explain how the sample is biased. Note: Page 2 of the handout provides sample answers for teacher reference ONLY. Do NOT distribute page 2 to students. LMR_3.11Q LMR_3.11 Each student should complete the handout independently. Afterwards, conduct a whole-class discussion to compare and contrast different students\u2019 explanations of how the samples might be biased. For each example given in the handout, discuss who is most likely over-represented and who is most likely under-represented in the sample. Ask the students: Now that we have learned about sampling biases, how can we eliminate this type of bias? Answers will vary by class. Note: Allow students to collaborate and come up with a few ideas on their own of how to eliminate sampling bias. If desired, ideas can be written on the board for discussion and comparison. Conclude with the actual answer: random sampling . If we randomly sample people from our population of interest, we can reduce the bias of any sample statistics obtained from the survey responses. If we have a biased sample, we can only give descriptions about that particular sample; we CANNOT generalize to the population of interest.","title":"Lesson:"},{"location":"unit3/lesson12/#class-scribes","text":"One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.","title":"Class Scribes:"},{"location":"unit3/lesson12/#homework","text":"Students will complete the Survey Sampling handout ( LMR_3.12 ) for homework.

Because of this, it is better to give a range of plausible values, rather than a single value. Lesson: Remind students that they have been learning about why sampling allows us to make inferences about a population. Some methods of sampling produce biased sample statistics, which does not allow us to generalize the results from a sample to the population of interest. To obtain unbiased statistics, random sampling methods need to be used. Conduct a class brainstorm about what it means to \u201cestimate\u201d something. Have students come up with possible synonyms for the word \u201cestimate.\u201d Some example synonyms include: guess, approximation, projection, opinion, impression, etc. Inform students that, in statistics, to provide an estimate means that we can give a range of values that we are confident include the population parameter value. In today\u2019s lesson, explain that the students will be playing a game, called The Confidence Game , in which they will be asked a series of questions that each have one numerical answer. However, instead of guessing what the exact answer is, the students will create a range of possible values that they think might include the real answer. They should be 90% confident that the true value is within their interval. Introduce The Confidence Game to students by first going through an example using the question: How tall is the Empire State Building, in feet (including the spire at the very top)? Ask the students to write down an interval , or range, of values that they think contains the true height of the building. Have a few students share their intervals with the class and discuss any obvious similarities or differences between them. For example: If Student A gives an interval from 500 to 2000 feet and Student B gives an interval from 1100 to 1400 feet, one discussion could stem from asking Student A why he or she isn\u2019t as sure of the answer as Student B is (since Student B gave a narrower interval). Then see if Student A wants to change his or her interval. After the discussion, tell the students that the actual height of the Empire State Building is 1,454 feet tall. Take a poll to see how many students\u2019 intervals contained this value. We will learn what it means to have the true value in our intervals after we play the game. Now, we can actually play the game! Distribute The Confidence Game handout ( LMR_3.13 ) and explain the rules. Students will have about 5 minutes to complete the handout, which gives them approximately 30 seconds per question. Note: The rules are printed at the beginning of the handout. They are included here for your convenience. Each question must be answered WITH AN INTERVAL. You should choose your interval so that you are \u201c90% confident\u201d (whatever that means to you). You CANNOT use any reference tools (i.e. no cell phones or computers to find answers). A question is \u201ccorrect\u201d if the true answer is inside your interval. The winner is determined by who got the most questions correct. In the case of a tie, the winner is chosen by whose intervals were narrower. LMR_3.13 Once each student has completed The Confidence Game handout ( LMR_3.13 ), have students choose partners and exchange handouts so that they can grade each other. Remind them that a question is marked as \u201ccorrect\u201d if the actual value (see answers in Step 8) falls within the interval. Display the answers for each of the 10 questions from the handout found below: 1) In what year did Mickey Mouse make his film debut? 1928 2) What is the lowest temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit) ever recorded in California? -45 degrees Fahrenheit 3) During the year 2014, how many television series were aired? 1,715 TV shows 4) How far away, in miles, is Earth from the moon? 238,900 miles 5) What is the greatest number of children officially recorded that were all born to one mother? 69 children 6) In what year did Orville and Wilbur Wright, more commonly known as the Wright brothers, make the first-ever powered flight in a plane? 1903 7) As of June 2015, how many of Rihanna\u2019s songs have reached the Number 1 spot on Billboard\u2019s \u201cDance Club Hits\u201d chart? 23 songs 8) How many years have actors Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith been married? As of January 2016, it was 18 years - they were married December 31, 1997. 9) How many hours will it take to complete a cross-country road trip from Los Angeles to New York City according to Google Maps? 41 hours (2,789.5 miles) 10) How many baseball fans can attend game at Dodger Stadium during any given day? 56,000 fans Each student should write the total number of \u201ccorrect\u201d responses at the top of his or her partner\u2019s handout, and then return it. Engage the students in a discussion about how well they did at estimating the true values with their intervals. The following questions can be used to steer the discussion: Remember that we were aiming to be 90% confident for each question. Based on this, how many of the 10 questions should we each have gotten correct? If we are 90% confident, then we would expect 90% of the 10 intervals to include the true value, which is 9 intervals. Did anyone in the class get exactly 9 correct? Did anyone get all 10 correct? Answers will vary by class. However, it is very unlikely that many students will have gotten 9 or 10 correct responses on this first round. Create a dotplot on the board (or on poster paper) titled \u201cNumber Correct\u201d and have each student record his or her value. Then, ask: How many students got 9 correct? In other words, how many students were actually 90% confident of their intervals? Answers will vary by class. What is the typical number of correct responses for our class? Does it seem too high or too low? Explain. Answers will vary by class. Most likely, the typical number of correct responses will be fairly low (maybe even 4 or less). Why is our typical score so much lower than 9? We tend to be more confident than we should be, so we create narrower intervals. It looks like, even though we thought we were 90% confident, most of us (or all of us) did not succeed 90% of the time. How could we increase our level of confidence? We could use wider intervals. Recall from Step 3 that, in statistics, to estimate something means that we can give a range of values that we are confident include the population parameter value. This range of values, like the ones the students created during The Confidence Game activity, is known as a confidence interval . Students will continue to learn about confidence intervals during the next lesson .

Objective: Students will learn about informal confidence intervals and estimates for the margin of error. Materials: Dotplot titled \u201cMean Word Length, Random Sample, Size = 10\u201d \u2013 from Lesson 11 Vocabulary: margin of error bootstrapping Essential Concepts: Essential Concepts: The margin of error expresses our uncertainty in an estimate. The estimate, plus or minus the margin of error, gives us an interval in which we are very confident the true value lies. Lesson: In this lesson, students will learn about confidence intervals in more detail. Display the dotplot the class created during Lesson 11 (The Gettysburg Address) titled \u201cMean Word Length, Random Sample, Size = 10.\u201d Have students recall that each dot represents one student\u2019s calculation of the mean word length of a sample of 10 randomly selected words from the Gettysburg Address. Also remind them that the population parameter, which is the mean word length of all words in the speech, was 4.22. There should already be a vertical line on the dotplot to indicate this value, but if it is not present, please add it during this step. Ask: What vocabulary word was used to describe each of the sample means we each created during Lesson 11 ? The sample statistic. Every dot on the graph represents one sample statistic, more specifically each dot corresponds to a different sample mean. How many of us got exactly the right value? Probably none. Thinking back on The Confidence Game we played yesterday, what approach could we do so that 90% of us would be correct? We could give an interval. Show students that they can give an interval in the form: Your sample statistic plus or minus AMOUNT Ask them to calculate what their AMOUNT must be so that their interval includes the parameter value. Ask them to write this as an interval. Choose one student to illustrate what is to be done. Ask them for their AMOUNT. On the dotplot, find their value, and use bars to go out plus and minus the AMOUNT. Confirm that it includes the parameter value. For example: The purple dot represents a sample mean of 3.5. The AMOUNT we have chosen for this particular case is 0.8, so the lower bracket is 0.8 below the sample mean, and the upper bracket is 0.8 above the sample mean. Notice that the population parameter is included within the brackets. Now, convert this to an interval of the form [lowest value, highest value] by subtracting the amount from the sample statistic to get the lowest value, and adding to get the highest. Inform students that this AMOUNT is called the margin of error . Explain that the students all now have different margins of error because in this unusual 'game' they know the population value. But in real life we do not, and so we have to choose one single margin of error that will work 90% of the time. Ask the students what margin of error they should use so that 90% of the estimates will have a 'successful' interval. You might want to tell them how many estimates that is for your class. A ballpark figure for the margin of error is 1.3. Explain: If we were to start all over, we could imagine picking one of these sample statistics at random. What's the probability that the sample statistic plus or minus the margin of error would include the parameter value? 90%. Because of this, we call these 'confidence intervals.' When we report an interval, for example 2.7 to 4.3, we say \"We are 90% confident that the population parameter value is between 2.7 and 4.3.\" This is another way of saying \"We don't know what the exact true value is, but we're confident it is somewhere in this interval.\" Remind students of the Pew Poll they discussed during Lesson 10 . For reference, the Pew Research Center made the following statement in their August 2015 report titled Teens, Technology & Friendships: Pew Poll \u201cFor today\u2019s teens, friendships can start digitally: 57% of teens have met new friends online. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.7 percentage points. Social media and online gameplay are the most common digital venues for meeting friends.\u201d Note: The data for this report were collected via interviews of 1,060 teenagers between the ages of 13 and 17. Now that students have learned about the margin of error, have them write an Exit Slip about what the margin of error means in context of the Pew Poll. Conclusions and takeaways: Estimates that are based on random samples vary. We can measure this variation. The margin of error can tell us how much estimates vary. We can use the estimate from our random sample, along with the margin of error, to give us a range of plausible values for the population parameter. This is called a confidence interval. If time allows, introduce students to the idea of bootstrapping , which is where we take random samples of really large samples. For example, if we were looking at Twitter data, it would be almost impossible to compile every single tweet that exists in the population. Instead, we might be able to access 500,000 tweets, which is a very large sample. From this sample, we could create smaller random samples of size 100 and make inferences about the overall population of tweets from these samples. This will be discussed further in Lab 3D .

Objective: Students will learn what sensors are and how they are used to collect data. Materials: Video: Play Like Nadal With a Smart Tennis Racket https://youtu.be/lcBnzddQECc Computers (see Step 5) Poster paper Flags in 3 different colors Advanced preparation required (see Step 10 below) Vocabulary: sensor trigger algorithm Essential Concepts: Essential Concepts: Sensors are another data collection method. Unlike what we have seen so far, sensors do not involve humans (much). They collect data according to an algorithm. Lesson: Entrance Ticket: What are some of the data collection methods we have learned about so far in this unit? We have learned about experiments, observational studies, surveys, and getting data from a URL (in Lab 3B ). Inform students that, in this lesson, they will be introduced to another data collection method known as sensors. With a partner, ask students to discuss what they think a sensor is. Ask each pair to write down their ideas. Show the Play Like Nadal With a Smart Tennis Racket video found at: https://youtu.be/lcBnzddQECc . As students watch the video, they should think about other sensors they may have come across, particularly ones used with smartphones. After watching the video, ask students to add to their definition of a sensor. Now, inform students that they will work in teams to compile a list of data-collecting sensors. They may use computers to conduct online research for this part of the lesson. Challenge each team to generate the longest list in the class. After students have had time to research and create their lists, ask students in each team to number off one through four (or five, depending on team sizes). Share out in rounds. First, ask students in each team whose number is one to share one sensor from their list. On the poster paper, create a class list of sensors as shared by the students. Repeat with the rest of the numbers. Score keeping: Each person gets five seconds to respond. You may hold up your hand with the palm facing the students and count down. The rules for teams are as follows: add a sensor to the list, get 1 point repeat an answer, lose 1 point do not answer in five seconds, lose a turn do not have an answer to contribute, may pass Note: You may reward the winning team with extra credit points, if desired. Next, students will engage in an activity to see sensors in action. Create 3 groups of students: Group 1 \u2013 Triggers (3 students) Provide each Trigger a different colored flag (for example: Pink , Purple , Green ). The teacher will call out a color, at random, and the Trigger assigned to that color will raise his or her flag. Each flag corresponds to a research question of interest. Pink \u2013 Who is in our class? Purple \u2013 What is on our classroom walls? Green \u2013 What do we like to do after school? Group 2 \u2013 Sensors (2 students) Each Sensor should be assigned to one Trigger, or colored flag ( Pink = Sensor A, Purple = Sensor B, Green = no sensor assigned to it). When the Sensors see their assigned Trigger, they send a signal to the Collector (see below) telling him or her to collect data from another student in the class. The Sensors are basically gobetweens for the Triggers and the Collector. Group 3 \u2013 Collector (1 student) One student is the Collector of all the data. The Collector is in charge of asking survey questions related to the research question of the original Trigger. Survey questions are provided here: Survey questions related to the Pink trigger: (1) How did you get to school today (bus, car, walking, etc.)? (2) What size shoe do you wear? (3) What is your favorite pizza topping? Survey questions related to the Purple trigger: (1) What is your favorite wall decoration? (2) What type of poster is it (motivational, reference, class work, etc.)? (3) What color is most prevalent in the poster? Survey questions related to the Green trigger: (1) Do you have a sports team practice or club meeting today? (2) Are you hanging out with friends today after school? (3) Will you be working today after school? Each time a sensor is active, the Collector must ask a new student in the class the appropriate survey questions. Explain the activity to your students. Then, call out a flag color at random. Repeat several times. Make sure you call out the flag that has no assignment at least once so that students see that no action took place. Reflect on the activity with the following discussion questions: What data were missed? Why? Data about what our class likes to do after school. They were missed because there was no Sensor connected to the Green trigger, so the Collector never knew to collect this type of data. Grocery stores keep track of customer data when purchases are made with a loyalty card. What is the trigger in this case? What data are being collected? The trigger is checking out at a grocery store. There are lots of data that are collected, including: items bought, cost of items, number of items on sale, etc. After they engage in the sensor activity, ask students to revisit their definition of a sensor (see Step 3). Have them revise their definition based on the following concepts: A sensor is a converter that measures a physical quantity and converts it into a signal, which can be read by an observer or by an instrument. A sensor collects data continuously, or whenever a trigger is activated. A trigger is a something that responds to an event so that an action can occur. Sensors collect data according to an algorithm . An algorithm is a process or set of rules that are followed (just like the rules followed during the activity). Sensors may also collect data automatically, without anyone\u2019s knowledge or input. Examples include GPS location, time, and date. Class Scribes: One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were. Homework Now that students learned what sensors are, ask them what data they would they like to see collected on a sensor that they couldn't collect in an experiment or survey. They must explain why it is difficult to collect that data in an experiment or survey, and how a sensor would make it easier to collect that data.","title":"Lesson 15: Ready, Sense, Go!"},{"location":"unit3/lesson15/#lesson-15-ready-sense-go","text":"","title":"Lesson 15: Ready, Sense, Go!"},{"location":"unit3/lesson15/#objective","text":"Students will learn what sensors are and how they are used to collect data.","title":"Objective:"},{"location":"unit3/lesson15/#materials","text":"Video: Play Like Nadal With a Smart Tennis Racket https://youtu.be/lcBnzddQECc Computers (see Step 5) Poster paper Flags in 3 different colors Advanced preparation required (see Step 10 below)","title":"Materials:"},{"location":"unit3/lesson15/#vocabulary","text":"sensor trigger algorithm","title":"Vocabulary:"},{"location":"unit3/lesson15/#essential-concepts","text":"Essential Concepts: Sensors are another data collection method.

We have learned about experiments, observational studies, surveys, and getting data from a URL (in Lab 3B ). Inform students that, in this lesson, they will be introduced to another data collection method known as sensors. With a partner, ask students to discuss what they think a sensor is. Ask each pair to write down their ideas. Show the Play Like Nadal With a Smart Tennis Racket video found at: https://youtu.be/lcBnzddQECc . As students watch the video, they should think about other sensors they may have come across, particularly ones used with smartphones. After watching the video, ask students to add to their definition of a sensor. Now, inform students that they will work in teams to compile a list of data-collecting sensors. They may use computers to conduct online research for this part of the lesson. Challenge each team to generate the longest list in the class. After students have had time to research and create their lists, ask students in each team to number off one through four (or five, depending on team sizes). Share out in rounds. First, ask students in each team whose number is one to share one sensor from their list. On the poster paper, create a class list of sensors as shared by the students. Repeat with the rest of the numbers. Score keeping: Each person gets five seconds to respond. You may hold up your hand with the palm facing the students and count down. The rules for teams are as follows: add a sensor to the list, get 1 point repeat an answer, lose 1 point do not answer in five seconds, lose a turn do not have an answer to contribute, may pass Note: You may reward the winning team with extra credit points, if desired. Next, students will engage in an activity to see sensors in action. Create 3 groups of students: Group 1 \u2013 Triggers (3 students) Provide each Trigger a different colored flag (for example: Pink , Purple , Green ). The teacher will call out a color, at random, and the Trigger assigned to that color will raise his or her flag. Each flag corresponds to a research question of interest. Pink \u2013 Who is in our class? Purple \u2013 What is on our classroom walls? Green \u2013 What do we like to do after school? Group 2 \u2013 Sensors (2 students) Each Sensor should be assigned to one Trigger, or colored flag ( Pink = Sensor A, Purple = Sensor B, Green = no sensor assigned to it). When the Sensors see their assigned Trigger, they send a signal to the Collector (see below) telling him or her to collect data from another student in the class. The Sensors are basically gobetweens for the Triggers and the Collector. Group 3 \u2013 Collector (1 student) One student is the Collector of all the data. The Collector is in charge of asking survey questions related to the research question of the original Trigger. Survey questions are provided here: Survey questions related to the Pink trigger: (1) How did you get to school today (bus, car, walking, etc.)? (2) What size shoe do you wear? (3) What is your favorite pizza topping? Survey questions related to the Purple trigger: (1) What is your favorite wall decoration? (2) What type of poster is it (motivational, reference, class work, etc.)? (3) What color is most prevalent in the poster? Survey questions related to the Green trigger: (1) Do you have a sports team practice or club meeting today? (2) Are you hanging out with friends today after school? (3) Will you be working today after school? Each time a sensor is active, the Collector must ask a new student in the class the appropriate survey questions. Explain the activity to your students.

Lesson: Refer back to the list of sensors the class created during the previous lesson. Distribute a piece of poster paper to each student team, and have them create the following table: Assign each student team 3 sensors from the class\u2019s list. Then, each team should complete the table using their knowledge of triggers discussed during the previous lesson. Remind students that when a trigger occurs, a sensor reacts to it and sends a signal to a data collector. Conduct a Gallery Walk of the posters. Each team will get to write one reaction or question about what they see on each poster. After the Gallery Walk, ask each team to return to their posters. If the posters include questions, have teams take turns responding to the questions. Quickwrite : In their DS Journals, ask student to respond to the following questions. They will have two minutes to write as much as they can: a. When you learned about survey questions, what were the two categories of questions you learned about? Answer: Open-ended and Closed-ended are the categories. b. What are some examples of these types of questions? Open-ended: write a paragraph, comments, essays, write a sentence, single answer. Closed-ended: multiple or single choice, yes/no, scales (e.g. 1-5), choose from a list, check a box. In teams, ask students to share their responses using the Give One/Get One strategy.

Explain that survey questions are asked in Participatory Sensing campaigns. There is no difference in the type of questions that are asked when collecting data via surveys and when collecting data via PS campaigns. When deciding whether to use a survey or a PS campaign for data collection, we have to look at the research question of interest. Some questions are better answered with survey data, while others with PS campaigns. Research questions that include variation across time or across locations are good candidates for PS. Some questions might be answered by both. For example: Consider the research question: How does my sense of safety and security change as I go about my daily routine? This question would best be answered via a PS campaign because students could collect data in real time about their sense of security. A possible trigger could be \"whenever you change locations\" or \"once at the start of every hour\" or perhaps whenever a random alarm goes off. Consider the research question: What proportion of high school students are superstitious? This question could be done with a survey based on a random sample from the population of all high school students. Distribute the Sensor or Survey? ( LMR_3.14 ) handout.

In the share-out, guide students to see that the questions are in fact survey questions. Although survey questions are answered once, when we collect data every time a 'trigger' event occurs, then we are engaging in Participatory Sensing.

Creating this class campaign will follow a process in which consensus (or a majority rule) will be reached in each step of the campaign development within each team. Inform students that they will be creating a Participatory Sensing campaign on a topic of their interest using LMR_3.16 . LMR_3.16 Round 1: First, teams will discuss their hobbies, areas of interest, or places or processes they want to know more about. Prompt students to think about whether they want to learn about \"where they live, work, or play.\" All students within the group must agree on a hobby or area of interest to be their topic of interest to create a campaign for. An example of a hobby is practicing cello. An area of interest might be 'the environment.' A place of interest might be \"our school\" or \"my church\" or \"Disneyland.\" Once teams have decided on a topic for their group, have teams share out their topic of interest. As a class, decide on one topic that will be used for creating a new Campaign. Round 2: Now have teams consider what research questions you might ask about this topic of interest. An example of a research question for practicing cello is \u201cHow can I improve my playing?\u201d or \"How can I practice more effectively?\" Once teams have decided on a research question for their group, have teams share out their research question. As a class, decide on one research question that will be used for creating a new Campaign. Round 3: Next, they will examine what kind of data needs to be collected in order to answer this research question. They should discuss possible triggers that will determine when data should be collected. Allow teams to engage in a discussion about when is the best time to trigger the data collection/completion of the survey. For example: every day at 8am; whenever they practice the cello; whenever they see an advertisement; etc. They should record it in their DS Journals. An example of a trigger for practicing cello is whenever you play the cello. In this case, it could be any time of day or even multiple times of the day.

These Campaigns should be evaluated before implementing to make sure they are reasonable and ethically sound. Lesson: Review homework by giving students about five minutes to share their classifications in their teams. They will decide as a team which classification is the most fitting. Once the five minutes have passed, have a class discussion of classifications and their justifications. Explain to the class that the campaign must be carried out by the whole class so if it has been classified in the Individual category, it must be revised. Also discuss whether the campaign is feasible. (For example, is the trigger so rare that no one will collect data? Are the questions too intrusive?). Inform students that one of the promises of PS is its potential for helping people bring about social and civic change. Ask teams to consider the following questions and report back: Does our campaign try to do this? Could it be changed or modified to do this? Note: Feasible campaigns fall under the groups of people or community categories. If a campaign is in the individual category, it should be modified to fall under the other categories before moving to round 4.

How does this question help address the research question? Does the question need to be reworded? (Is it clear what is being asked for? Do they know how to answer it?) If the survey questions need to be rewritten, assign teams to rewrite survey questions. Then, as a class, decide on the changes. Once finalized, write the survey question that goes along with that data variable, being cognizant of question bias. Round 5: In teams, now generate two to three statistical questions that they might answer with these data. Make sure your statistical questions are interesting and relevant to the class topic of interest. They may keep a record in their DS Journals. Remind students that they will also have data about the date, time, and place of data collection. Examples of statistical questions that can be answered for practicing cello are: \u201cHow frequently do I practice?\u201d \u201cWhen I practice more frequently, do I rate my sessions higher?\u201d \u201cAre higher-rated sessions associated with time of day?\u201d Once teams have generated their statistical questions, have them share out with the class. Confirm that the questions are statistical and that they can be answered with the data the students propose to collect. As a class, decide on no more than 3 statistical questions to guide your campaign. Now that they have all the pieces of the campaign, evaluate whether it\u2019s a reasonable and ethically sound campaign. Engage the class in a whole group discussion on the following questions: Are answers to your survey questions likely to vary when the trigger occurs? (If not, you'll get bored entering the same data again and again) Can the entire class carry out the campaign? Do triggers occur so rarely that you'll have very little data? Do they occur so often that you'll get frustrated entering too much data? Ethics: Would sharing these data with strangers or friends be embarrassing or undermine someone's privacy? Can you change your trigger or survey questions to improve your evaluation? Will you be able to gather enough relevant data from your survey questions to be able to answer your statistical questions? Students have collaboratively created their first Participatory Sensing campaign. Inform them that you will be demonstrating one tool used to create the campaigns that they see on their smart devices or the computer. Students should take notes in their DS journals, as they will be using the tool later.

They will decide as a team which classification is the most fitting. Once the five minutes have passed, have a class discussion of classifications and their justifications. Explain to the class that the campaign must be carried out by the whole class so if it has been classified in the Individual category, it must be revised. Also discuss whether the campaign is feasible. (For example, is the trigger so rare that no one will collect data? Are the questions too intrusive?). Inform students that one of the promises of PS is its potential for helping people bring about social and civic change. Ask teams to consider the following questions and report back: Does our campaign try to do this? Could it be changed or modified to do this? Note: Feasible campaigns fall under the groups of people or community categories. If a campaign is in the individual category, it should be modified to fall under the other categories before moving to round 4. Display the campaign information students generated (and selected as a class) the previous day or revised today: Topic, Research question, Trigger, and Type of Data needed. Now they will continue the rounds using the Campaign Creation handout LMR 3.16 from the previous lesson. Round 4: Now that the class has decided on a trigger and the type of data needed, they will create survey questions to ask when the trigger is set. The questions should consider all of the possible data they might collect at this trigger event. It's ok if the list is long; the goal is to be creative and think of lots of different ideas.

Objective: Students will learn about the elements of an experiment and the meaning of \"causation\". Students will learn to distinguish claims of causation from claims of association. Materials: Video: MythBusters\u2019 Is Yawning Contagious? Note: Please use a search engine (e.g., Google Video) and type \u201cMythBusters Is Yawning Contagious\u201d to find it. The clip is a little over 5 minutes in length. If you cannot access it, an alternate experiment (MythBusters' How Does Music Affect Plants ) can be found at https://youtu.be/C5dNhNfGyWQ Vocabulary: experiment subjects treatment treatment group control group random assignment outcome research question confounding factors Essential Concepts: Essential Concepts: Science is often concerned with the question \"What causes things to happen?\". To answer this, controlled experiments are required. Controlled experiments have several key features: (1) there is a treatment variable and a response variable, and we wish to see if the treatment causes a change that we can measure with the response variable; (2) There is a comparison/control group; (3) Subjects are assigned randomly to treatment or control (randomized assignment); (4) Subjects are not aware of which group they are in (a 'blind'). This may require the use of a placebo for those in the control group; and (5) those who measure the response variable do not know which group the subjects were in (if both 4 and 5 are satisfied, this is a 'double blind' experiment). Lesson: Display the following headlines to students: Stop Global Warming: Become a Pirate Lack of sleep may shrink your brain Early language skills reduce preschool tantrums Dogs walked by men are more aggressive Discuss each headline by asking the following questions: What is the headline implying with its wording? 1a is implying that you can stop global warming by becoming a pirate, 1b is implying that it\u2019s possible to shrink your brain if you aren\u2019t getting enough sleep, 1c is implying that having early language skills will decrease preschool tantrums, 1d is implying that dogs are more aggressive when they\u2019ve been walked by men. Is it implying causation or association? Discuss definitions of causation and association. Causation means there is a cause and effect relationship between variables. For example, heat causes water to boil; whereas association or correlation means that high values of one variable tend to be associated with high values of the other (or high values tend to be with low values). However, this is not necessarily cause-and-effect at play. For example, blanket sales in Canada are associated with brush fires in Australia - not because Canadian blankets cause the fires, but because Canadian winters cause blanket sales, and Canadian winters are Australian summers, which cause fires. 1a, 1c and 1d are implying causation and 1b is implying association. How can you tell the difference between causation and correlation? What words stand out in these headlines? Answers will vary but some terms for causation include: cause, increase/ decrease, benefits, impacts, effect/ affect, etc.; and for correlation include: get, have, linked, more/ less, tied, connected, etc. In 1a, \u201cbecome\u201d stands out; in 1b, \u201cmay\u201d stands out; in 1c, \u201creduce\u201d stands out; in 1d, \u201care\u201d stands out. Change each causal version of a headline into a non-causal version and vice versa. Answers will vary but an example for 1a is to instead say Global Warming linked to increase of pirates. Introduce the MythBusters video clip by answering the following questions, in teams, for their headline \u201cIs Yawning Contagious?\u201d What is the headline implying with its wording? That yawning may cause other people to yawn. Is it implying causation or correlation? How do you know? Causation because \u201ccontagious\u201d yawns means that you are yawning because someone else has yawned. How can we determine if this is true? Split the class into groups and have each team come up with a way to determine if this is true. Each group should assume that they get to examine 50 people. Show the MythBusters video clip called Is Yawning Contagious? The links to the clips can be found in the Materials above. Focus students on the following guiding questions and ask them to take notes as they watch the video clip: How did the MythBusters design the investigation? What steps did they take? How is this different than your team\u2019s headline responses? After viewing the clip, inform students that the MythBusters have just conducted an experiment , which is one method of data collection. We begin with a brief introduction into \u201cwhat is an experiment\u201d but the definition will be developed over the next several lessons. Guide students to identify the elements of an experiment by referring back to the video clip: Research Question \u2014 the question to be answered by the experiment ( Is Yawning Contagious? ) Subjects \u2013 people or objects that are participating in the experiment ( the 50 adults ) Treatment \u2013 the variable that is deliberately manipulated to investigate its influence on the outcome; this is sometimes known as the explanatory, or independent, variable ( Kari yawned before subject entered the room ) Treatment group \u2013 the group of subjects that receive the treatment ( two out of every three subjects who were placed into rooms \u2013 yawn from Kari ) Control group \u2013 the group that does not receive a treatment ( one out of every three subjects who were placed into rooms \u2013 no yawn from Kari ) Random assignment \u2013 subjects are randomly assigned to either the treatment or control group ( two out of every three subjects received the treatment - in this experiment, random assignment was not used (or if it was, we were not told so) ) Outcome \u2013 the variable that the treatment is meant to influence; this is sometimes known as the response, or dependent, variable ( whether or not a person yawned ) Statistic \u2014 a method for comparing the outcomes of the control and treatment groups (this is needed) In this case, the MythBusters used the difference between the percent of subjects that yawned in the treatment group, which was 4% higher than the control group. Note: In this experiment, and in those found in the IDS curriculum, we use a treatment and a control group. However, a control group is not a necessary element of an experiment. Sometimes it is more appropriate to have two treatment groups with no control group (e.g., medical professionals testing different doses of drugs). The effect that is being studied will dictate whether to feature a control group or not. Display the following questions on the board or projector. Using T-I-P-S , ask students to discuss them. Why did the MythBusters follow all of these steps to design their experiment? In order to determine if watching someone yawn can cause you to yawn. We don't know how MythBusters chose who would be in the treatment group and who would be in the control group. Suppose that the people who showed up first, early in the morning, were assigned to the treatment group, and the last few people, later in the day, ended up in the control group. Would you believe in the conclusions? No, because the two groups were different. The first group might have been sleepier, and so more likely to yawn anyways. Explain that this --another explanation for the cause-and-effect-- is called a confounding variable. Explain that in order to make the two groups as similar as possible, experimenters usually assign subjects randomly. How might we randomly assign about half of the subjects to the treatment and half to the control? We might flip a coin, and those who get Heads go to Treatment. Why would random assignment improve the MythBusters experiment? Because then the two groups would be more similar, so we wouldn't have a confounding variable to worry about. Emphasize that without random assignment, we cannot determine causation because we are not comparing two similar groups.

Lesson: By a show of hands, ask students if they have ever heard of the term data farm . If any of them have, ask him or her to share what they know about it. Inform students that a data farm is a physical space where high capacity servers are placed to store large amounts of data.

After students watch the video, have a class discussion using the following questions: We have been talking about data for a few months now. How would you respond if someone asked you, \u201cWhat are data?\u201d Answers will vary by class. What are some ways that we have stored data? Data frames in R, Excel spreadsheets, .csv files. Explain that one of the main ways data are distributed is through the Internet. Storing and sharing data on the Internet requires a different format than what we have seen. For example, Wikipedia has a page dedicated to the top video games. Distribute the Wikipedia \u2013 Video Games handout ( LMR_3.17 ), and have students explain the information that the data table provides. LMR_3.17 Once the students understand what the data table describes, walk them through the first portion of the HTML , or Hypertext Markup Language, source code (on page 1). Notice that the first header on the table is denoted as \u201cGame.\u201d Ask: How is \u201cGame\u201d represented in the source code? <th>Game</th> What do you think the <th> code represents? The <th> is a tag for \u201ctable header\u201d If this were in RStudio, what would we call this header? A variable . Assign each student team one video game from the Wikipedia data table. Each team will compare how the information is stored in the table with its corresponding HTML source code. Each team should answer the following questions in the DS journals. Where are the variable names stored? The variable names are stored at the beginning of the code, in between <th> and </th>. <th> and </th> are called tags \u2013 they tell the browser to represent the information between them as a header in the table. How are different values of the variables stored? Values are stored between the <td> and </td> tags. Why do you think the data are stored in such a complex way? Why can\u2019t we just put them in a spreadsheet? Answers may vary by class. One reason is that the data must be displayed in a way that allows a browser to make it look pretty (and readable) on a computer screen. How could we get this into an R dataframe so we can analyze it? In its current form, this would be very difficult.

We create basic XML \"tags\" in the code, which help us store data in a format we understand. Lesson: Allow time for student teams to present their findings from the Online Data-ing handout ( LMR_3.19 ) if there was not sufficient time during the previous lesson. Remind students that in the previous lesson they learned about a variety of ways that data can be presented online. They've been working with comma separated (CSV) files and R data frames. Last time and in the lab, they worked with HTML tables. Today they are going to learn how HTML can be displayed as an XML table. XML , or Extensible Mark up Language, is a popular format for storing data on the Internet. It is useful because it creates readable web pages, and also because it allows programmers to easily update values in the data table if those values change. In pairs, ask students to brainstorm ways in which data that is found online is different than the way we see data in RStudio. Then, create a class brainstorm from the student pair responses. After the brainstorm, emphasize the following: RStudio\u2019s default way to work with data is as large data frames (tables) where rows represent observations and columns represent variables. Data that is viewed online often has a different structure. Data structures found on the web might be displayed in tables, such as those on Wikipedia, or streams, such as Twitter, and might even include data spread across multiple sections of a web page, such as Yelp. Show students, on a projector, the Mountain Peak XML data found at https://labs.idsucla.org/extras/webdata/mountains.html Ask students to look at the data and determine if they have seen it before. Hint: They have! It was the data they scraped during Lab 3E . Once students figure out that the XML is just the same data as the website they scraped during Lab 3E , distribute the Mountains \u2013 HTML vs. XML handout ( LMR_3.20 ), which displays both HTML and XML versions of the data. Note: The handout only includes the first 3 mountains. LMR_3.20 Ask student pairs to answer the following: Why are certain XML tags indented in the XML version of the data? The indentations tell us how to structure the HTML table. For example, all the mountains are contained in the <data> section, but are further tagged by each particular mountain within the <mountain> and </mountain> tags. All information stored between those two tags will be displayed as one row of the HTML table. What are the role of tags (ex. <state>) and end tags (ex. </state>) in the XML code? Tags tell us when a certain type of data begins, and end tags tell us when the data should end. In other words, it tells us where to find the specific values of a variable (ex. Alaska would be the value of the \u201cstate\u201d variable since it is between the <state> and </state> tags. Where are the variable names? The variable names can be found between each <mountain> and </mountain> tags. Specifically, the first variable is \u201cpeak\u201d and the last variable is \u201crank.\u201d Where are the observations? The observations are located within each of the variable tags. For example, the observation \u201cMount McKinley (Denali)\u201d is found between the <peak> and </peak> tags. Assign student pairs one of the above questions to share out with the class. Student pairs that did not receive an assignment must participate using the Agree/Disagree strategy. As a class, discuss the answers to the questions above. XML formats make it easier to display data on the web in a pleasant matter and make it easier for programmers to find and alter data if the values change or if, for example, they wish to add a new row to a table.

Objective: Students will explore the importance of randomized assignment in experiments. They will understand that without random assignment, there might be confounding variables and will be able to suggest possible confounding variables. Materials: Measuring Tape Essential Concepts: Essential Concepts: Randomized assignment is required to determine cause-and-effect. Lesson: Inform students that they will be exploring the question \u201cWhy do we need randomized assignment?\u201d by conducting an experiment. Tell students that you have a treatment that can make people taller. Explain that the class will be divided into two groups, one group will get the treatment, and one group will not. The group that does not receive the treatment will be the control group. After the treatment, they will measure the groups to see which is taller. Now divide the class into two groups by placing the boys in the treatment group and the girls in the control group. Remember that in an experiment we typically have a treatment group and a control group. In the MythBusters experiment, they compared number of yawns after treatment, and not any measurements before treatment, because they were comparing the treatment group to the control group (the control group is specifically here because it is a comparable untreated group - this allows us to not need \u201cbefore\u201d measurements). Therefore, in this case, we will run the experiment and then compare average height of the treatment group to the control group. Tell them that after the treatment group takes the treatment, your statistic to compare groups will be to measure the heights. If the treatment group is taller, then the treatment must have worked. There are two possible outcomes to dividing the class this way: The students will protest (as they should) and you can start a discussion as to why this is not a good way to divide the class. OR the students don\u2019t protest and you continue with the experiment. The treatment should be something silly, like waving a ruler in front of the person\u2019s face or by asking them to chant \u201cgrow, grow, grow!\u201d three times. After treatment, measure the heights of each group and ask them if they think this is good evidence ( do not say \u201cproves\u201d ) that the treatment is effective. Regardless of the outcome, students should recognize that by putting the boys in one group, the outcome was pre-determined, since boys tend to be taller than girls to begin with. This is an example of a confounding factor . Confounding factors are variables that provide an alternative explanation of the effect of the treatment on the outcome variable. Ask students: \u201cHow should students be put into groups?\u201d Discuss various other methods of grouping students. Someone will probably say to split the groups into equal numbers of boys and girls. At this suggestion, divide the class into two groups by placing the tallest boys and tallest girls in the treatment group, and the shorter boys and shorter girls in the control group. Students should be able to recognize that you shouldn\u2019t use any characteristics to decide the groups. Continue discussion of other ways to decide the groups. Use the following questions as a guide: What about flipping a coin? What will the gender balance look like? Each group should have about the same balance as the class, though not exactly. Why is it important that the groups be similar? Because otherwise, something else might be the cause of the response changing. Inform students that today the class will begin to design their own experiment using what they have learned over the last few lessons. The question they will investigate is: How does our perception of time change when exposed to a stimulus? They will be trying to determine the length of one minute without the use of time-aids. In their experiment, they will subject some students to a stimulus and others to no stimulus. They will then analyze the data to determine if subjecting students to a stimulus affects the perception of how long a minute of time lasts. In their DS journals, ask students to answer the following questions about the elements of their experiment: What is the research question we\u2019re interested in addressing? Who are the subjects that will be participating in the experiment? How should we randomly assign the subjects into treatment and control groups? (See step 12 for an RStudio method that the teacher can use) What is the outcome variable that we will be measuring? What unit of measurement should we use? Note: Students will decide on a treatment to apply to each group on the following day. As a class, discuss the responses to the questions above (step #9, a-d) and come to a consensus for each question\u2019s answer. Inform the class that they will be using the answers they have agreed upon as the final design of the class\u2019s experiment. At the end of the class, the students should be assigned to the treatment or control groups using the randomization method they chose as a class in step #9c. Note: One method to determine group assignment would be to use the class roster and the sample() function in RStudio.

Tell students that you have a treatment that can make people taller. Explain that the class will be divided into two groups, one group will get the treatment, and one group will not. The group that does not receive the treatment will be the control group. After the treatment, they will measure the groups to see which is taller. Now divide the class into two groups by placing the boys in the treatment group and the girls in the control group. Remember that in an experiment we typically have a treatment group and a control group. In the MythBusters experiment, they compared number of yawns after treatment, and not any measurements before treatment, because they were comparing the treatment group to the control group (the control group is specifically here because it is a comparable untreated group - this allows us to not need \u201cbefore\u201d measurements). Therefore, in this case, we will run the experiment and then compare average height of the treatment group to the control group. Tell them that after the treatment group takes the treatment, your statistic to compare groups will be to measure the heights. If the treatment group is taller, then the treatment must have worked. There are two possible outcomes to dividing the class this way: The students will protest (as they should) and you can start a discussion as to why this is not a good way to divide the class. OR the students don\u2019t protest and you continue with the experiment. The treatment should be something silly, like waving a ruler in front of the person\u2019s face or by asking them to chant \u201cgrow, grow, grow!\u201d three times. After treatment, measure the heights of each group and ask them if they think this is good evidence ( do not say \u201cproves\u201d ) that the treatment is effective. Regardless of the outcome, students should recognize that by putting the boys in one group, the outcome was pre-determined, since boys tend to be taller than girls to begin with. This is an example of a confounding factor . Confounding factors are variables that provide an alternative explanation of the effect of the treatment on the outcome variable. Ask students: \u201cHow should students be put into groups?\u201d Discuss various other methods of grouping students. Someone will probably say to split the groups into equal numbers of boys and girls. At this suggestion, divide the class into two groups by placing the tallest boys and tallest girls in the treatment group, and the shorter boys and shorter girls in the control group. Students should be able to recognize that you shouldn\u2019t use any characteristics to decide the groups. Continue discussion of other ways to decide the groups. Use the following questions as a guide: What about flipping a coin? What will the gender balance look like? Each group should have about the same balance as the class, though not exactly. Why is it important that the groups be similar? Because otherwise, something else might be the cause of the response changing. Inform students that today the class will begin to design their own experiment using what they have learned over the last few lessons. The question they will investigate is: How does our perception of time change when exposed to a stimulus? They will be trying to determine the length of one minute without the use of time-aids. In their experiment, they will subject some students to a stimulus and others to no stimulus. They will then analyze the data to determine if subjecting students to a stimulus affects the perception of how long a minute of time lasts. In their DS journals, ask students to answer the following questions about the elements of their experiment: What is the research question we\u2019re interested in addressing? Who are the subjects that will be participating in the experiment? How should we randomly assign the subjects into treatment and control groups? (See step 12 for an RStudio method that the teacher can use) What is the outcome variable that we will be measuring? What unit of measurement should we use? Note: Students will decide on a treatment to apply to each group on the following day. As a class, discuss the responses to the questions above (step #9, a-d) and come to a consensus for each question\u2019s answer. Inform the class that they will be using the answers they have agreed upon as the final design of the class\u2019s experiment. At the end of the class, the students should be assigned to the treatment or control groups using the randomization method they chose as a class in step #9c. Note: One method to determine group assignment would be to use the class roster and the sample() function in RStudio. The students have a number that corresponds to their placement on the roster (i.e. student 1\u2019s last name most likely starts with an A, and then we move alphabetically through the roster).

Feasibility , impossible to randomize: In certain cases, you cannot perform an experiment because it is impossible to randomly assign people to particular groups. For example, you cannot assign a gender to a person. Distribute What Should We Do? handout ( LMR_3.3 ). In teams, students will identify whether the research question could best be answered via an experiment or an observational study. Once all student teams have completed the handout, assign one research question to each team to report out. As each response is shared, conduct a whole-class discussion to compare which data collection method was most appropriate for each research question. Ensure everyone understands the reasons each method was chosen before moving on to the next scenario. Note: Page 2 of the handout is an answer key for teacher reference only! LMR_3.3 Next, student teams will generate three research questions on their own. They need to identify the best data collection method for answering their question and should provide an explanation. At least one of the three research questions should use an observational study for data collection. Using a share-out strategy, have the reporter of each team share one of their investigation questions with the rest of the class.","title":"Lesson:"},{"location":"unit3/lesson7/#class-scribes","text":"One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.","title":"Class Scribes:"},{"location":"unit3/lesson8/","text":"Lesson 8: Monsters that Hide in Observational Studies Objective: Students will learn about confounding factors that may impact the results of an observational study, which is why causation can never be concluded with observational studies, only associations between variables. Materials: Computers Spurious Correlations website ( tylervigen.com ) Vocabulary: cause confounding factors associated Essential Concepts: Essential Concepts: Confounding factors/variables make it difficult to determine a cause-and-effect relation between two variables. Lesson: Ask students to recall that they looked at the relationship between a student\u2019s GPA and the number of friends that person has on social media during lesson 6. It seemed that students with higher GPAs had more friends than students with lower GPAs. But did this mean that the cause of a person\u2019s GPA is the amount of friends they have? NO! They also identified other variables that could have contributed to the relationship, these outside variables are called confounding factors . Confounding factors are variables that are related to both the explanatory variable and the response variable in an observational study. Propose the following statement to students: \u201cResearch suggests that a rise in umbrella sales leads to decreased crime rates.\u201d Allow the students to work in teams to think about possible confounding factors. They should choose a variable that is related to umbrella sales, and that might lead to decreased crime rates. After they\u2019ve come up with a few possibilities, use the following diagram progression to further explain the impact of confounding factors. Step 1: Draw an arrow showing that \u201ca rise in umbrella sales leads to decreased crime rates\u201d since that is what researchers have stated. Step 2: Include the variable that might be related to people buying more umbrellas (i.e., the confounding factor). For example, when the weather is rainy, people buy more umbrellas. Step 3: Draw an additional arrow from \u201cWeather\u201d to \u201cCrime Rates Down\u201d because it is well known that when the weather is bad, people are less likely to be outside committing crimes. Step 4: Remind students that the original claim was that \u201ca rise in umbrella sales leads to decreased crime rates\u201d.\u201d However, we\u2019ve now shown that maybe buying umbrellas is not the only thing that could be contributing to a decrease in crime, which makes us question the link between the two variables. Step 5: Therefore, we have found a confounding factor with the variable \u201ccrime rates.\u201d This means we can erase the original \u201clink\u201d between a rise in umbrella sales and decreased crime rates since there are outside variables interfering. We can\u2019t say buying umbrellas causes decreased crime rates, but we can say that a rise in umbrella sales are associated with decreased crime rates. Once the students grasp what confounding factors are and how to identify them, introduce them to the website Spurious Correlations by Tyler Vigen. This site shows many explanatory and response variables that are randomly associated with each other. Spurious Correlations can be found at: http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations . For the example given above, we see that as the US spends more money on science, space, and technology, more people are dying by way of suicide. Clearly, it does not make sense that if the US keeps spending money on science, then more people are going to commit suicide. It simply happened by chance (or a bizarre chain of confounding factors) that the two variables are related to each other. Allow the students to explore the website on their own (Note: there are multiple pages of graphs, so they are not restricted to simply the homepage). They should choose a graph that interests them and answer the following questions in their DS journals: What are the two variables shown in your graph? Is there a positive association or a negative association between the variables? Write an interpretation of this plot in the context of the data. Write the data points in a \"spreadsheet format\" in a form that RStudio could read. Each row should represent a point on the graph, and each column one of the two variables. By hand, make a scatterplot of the association. Describe whether the association seems strong or weak or moderate to you. Do you think that the explanatory variable causes the response variable? Explain. If you answered 'no' to f, then draw a diagram like in #4 with possible confounding factors. Note: this can be difficult, depending on the graph chosen. Some factors to consider: weather, economy, fashion trends. Example answers to Step 7 are given below: What are the two variables shown in your graph? Total revenue generated by arcades in the US and the number of computer science doctorates awarded. Is there a positive association or a negative association between the variables? There is a direct relationship because the lines have the same shape (they follow the same pattern). Write an interpretation of this plot in the context of the data. It seems that as more doctorates are awarded to computer scientists, arcades are generating more revenue. Arcade Revenue CS doctorates 1196 861 1176 830 etc. Answers will vary. Can you conclude that the one variable causes the other? No. Although the two variables are associated with one another, we do not have evidence to say that more doctorate awards cause arcades to make more money because the data do not come from a controlled experiment. Draw a diagram like the one we did together earlier (in step 4 of lesson) with possible confounding factors. Student\u2019s diagram should look like the one below: Once all students have selected a graph and have answered the above questions, have them share their responses with a partner. They should explain why they thought their particular graph was interesting, how the two variables are related (directly or inversely), and whether or not there is a causal link between the variables. At the end of this lesson, students should understand that causation can only be concluded when an experiment is performed, but associations can be concluded for observational studies.

Writing such questions can be hard (but fun)! Lesson: Introduce one of the videos listed above by informing students that they will be watching a clip from the television game show Family Feud . This segment of the show is called Fast Money , where the winning family plays for an additional $20,000 (in the older video, they are playing for an additional $10,000 instead of $20,000). Two family members are chosen to play and must reach a combined score of 200 points to win the money. The goal is to guess the most common responses to five questions. For example, if the question \u201cWhat animal is a common pet?\u201d were asked, each family member might answer with \u201cdog\u201d or \u201ccat\u201d since these are popular household pets. The first person accumulates as many points as possible during the 20-second first round. The second person is given 25 seconds to earn points with different answers. As students watch the video, have them answer the following questions in their DS journals: How many people were surveyed? 100 Who was represented in the survey? Single men How many survey questions were asked? 5 When the host says \u201csurvey said\u201d and we see the response, what does it mean? It means that X number of people out of the 100 gave that response to the survey question. Family Feud uses surveys as its main data collection tool. In their DS journals, students should write down what they know about surveys individually. Then, with a partner, students will share what each one of them knows about surveys. Select a couple of students to either share their response or their partner\u2019s response with the whole class. Inform students that a survey is a data collection method where the data are self-reported , meaning that participants answer questions themselves. Surveys are composed of: Questionnaires or a series of questions A representative sample of the population of interest Carefully worded questions Surveys rely on questions. There are two types of questions that can be asked in a survey: open-ended questions and closed-ended questions . Open-ended questions offer a free-response/ text approach, whereas closed-ended questions give a fixed set of choices. Display the following list to the class. With a partner, have the students categorize the following types of questions as either open-ended or closed-ended: Multiple choice (closed) Write a paragraph (open) Yes/No (closed) Comments (open) Essays (open) On a scale from 1 to 5 (closed) Choose from a list (closed) Write a sentence (open) Check a box (closed) Do a quick Whip Around to share the categorization for each type of question. Be sure that students make corrections to the list if any items were miscategorized. Quickly review the Data Cycle. To give students an introduction to conducting surveys, they will first go through a practice scenario as a class to try to answer the following research question: What are \u2018families\u2019 in the United States? Distribute the Designing a Survey handout ( LMR_3.4 ) and let students fill in the boxes for \u201cResearch Topic\u201d (Families) and \u201cResearch Question\u201d (What are \u2018families\u2019 in the United States?) . LMR_3.4 Inform students that the left side of the handout will be completed as a class, and then student teams will work together to complete the right side. Using the Data Cycle as a guide, students should brainstorm a statistical investigative question that is related to the research question. One might be: What is the typical family size in the United States? Note: This requires a definition of \u201cfamily,\u201d which can have a variety of meanings to different people. Different definitions will likely guide the discussion of possible survey questions in the following step. Next, students need to determine 3 survey questions to help answer the statistical investigative question. The goal in creating survey questions is to make sure they (1) are unambiguous, and (2) address the statistical investigative question. Some examples are listed below (which come from different definitions of \u201cfamily\u201d): Note: Survey questions MUST match the statistical investigative question. How many siblings do you have? How many people live with you? It may help to actually collect data once the first survey question has been created. For example: \u201cHow many siblings do you have?\u201d \u2013 each student would give a response and the values could be recorded in a dotplot (if desired). If the question is too vague (do we include half-siblings, step-siblings, etc.?), students can revise the question. Once the class has agreed upon 3 survey questions for the first statistical investigative question, allow students to join their student teams for the remainder of the activity. Each team should come up with a statistical investigative question that might answer the research question, then determine 3 survey questions that match their statistical investigative question. Have the students create both open- and closed-ended questions in the handout. Each survey question should be a different type (see Step 8). Have student teams share out their statistical investigative questions and related survey questions with the rest of the class. Class Scribes: One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were. Homework & Next Day For homework, students should choose one of their team\u2019s survey questions and rewrite it 3 ways, using 3 different question types (see Step 8).

Materials: Practicum: Music to my ears ( LMR_U3_Practicum_Music to My Ears ) Note to Teacher: Before assigning the practicum to your students, engage the class in a discussion about experiments. Use the following questions as a guide to assess student understanding. When is random assignment used? Why is it important? Random assignment is used when you wish to determine whether a treatment causes changes in an outcome variable. It\u2019s important because it creates a \u201cbalance\u201d of the groups so that the only way the groups differ, on average, is that one gets the treatment and one does not. Thus, if there is a change in the outcome variable, only the treatment could have caused it. Below are some headlines, determine if they are causal or not. If not causal, re-write so that it is.

The control group is important because it allows us to measure the effects of the treatment group with an untreated comparable group. Without the control group, we don't know what would have happened if we had done nothing. [Think of a new vaccine for the flu. If there is no control group, and we see the treatment group improving, we will never know if they would have improved anyways, without the vaccine.] Practicum Music to my Ears In class, you designed and conducted the Time Perception experiment to find out if a person\u2019s perception of time changed when exposed to a stimulus. This experiment was designed so that it used random assignment, which is the process of using a chance device (e.g., dice, RStudio, etc.) to determine the placement of subjects into the treatment and control groups. By randomizing, you are removing other possible explanations for why the results happened the way they did.

Official data sets rely on censuses or random samples and can be used to make generalizations. On the other hand, data from Participatory Sensing campaigns are not random and rely on the sensors, in our case, humans, to be gathered and limits the ability to generalize. Lesson 2: Exploring Water Usage Exploring different data sets can give us insight about the same processes. Information from an official data set compared with a Participatory Sensing data set can yield more information than one data set alone. Research questions provide an overall direction to make comparisons between data sets. Lesson 3: Evaluating and Implementing a Water Campaign Statistical questions guide a Participatory Sensing campaign so that we can learn about a community or ourselves. These campaigns should be evaluated before implementing to make sure they are reasonable and ethically sound. Lesson 4: Learning About Our Water Campaign Statistical questions guide a Participatory Sensing campaign so that we can learn about a community or ourselves. These campaigns should be tried before implementing to make sure they are collecting the data they are meant to collect and refined accordingly. Lesson 5: Statistical Predictions using One Variable Anyone can make a prediction. But statisticians measure the success of their predictions. This lesson encourages the classroom to consider different measures of success. Lesson 6: Statistical Predictions by Applying the Rule If we use the squared residuals rule, then the mean of our current data is the best prediction of future values. If we use the mean absolute error rule, then the median of the current data is the best prediction of future values. Lesson 7: Statistical Predictions Using Two Variables When predicting values of a variable y, and if y is associated with x, then we can get improved predictions by using our knowledge about x. Basically, we \u201csubset\u201d the data for a given value of x, and use the mean y for those subset values. If the resulting means follow a trend, we can model this trend to generalize to as-yet unseen values of x. Lesson 8: What\u2019s the Trend? Associations are important because they help us make better predictions; the stronger the trend, the better the prediction we can make. \u201cBetter\u201d in this case means that our mean squared residuals can be made smaller. Lesson 9: Spaghetti Line We can often use a straight line to summarize a trend. \u201cEye balling\u201d a straight line to a scatterplot is one way to do this. Lesson 10: Predicting Values The regression line can be used to make good predictions about values of y for any given value of x. This works for exactly the same reason the mean works well for one variable: the predictions will make your score on the mean squared residuals as small as possible. Lesson 11: How Strong Is It? A high absolute value for correlation means a strong linear trend. A value close to 0 means a weak linear trend. Lesson 12: More Variables to Make Better Predictions We can use scatterplots to assess which variables might lead to strong predictive models. Sometimes using several predictors in one model can produce stronger models. Lesson 13: Combination of Variables If multiple predictors are associated with the response variable, a better predictive model will be produced, as measured by the mean absolute error. Lesson 14: Improving your Model If a linear model is fit to a non-linear trend, it will not do a good job of predicting. For this reason, we need to identify non-linear trends by looking at a scatterplot or the model needs to match the trend. Lesson 15: The Growth of Landfills Modeling does not always have to produce an equation. Instead, we can create models to answer real-world problems related to our community. Lesson 16: Exploring Trash via the Dashboard Exploring the IDS Dashboard provides a visual approach to data analysis. Lesson 17: Exploring Trash via RStudio RStudio can be used to verify initial results/findings from data analysis done via the IDS Dashboard. Lesson 18: Grow Your Own Classification Tree Many data sets have multiple predictors and are very non-linear. We can still use this data, but need to model it differently, such as in a decision tree. Decision trees are a useful tool for classifying observations into groups. Lesson 19: Data Scientists or Doctors? We can determine the usefulness of decision trees by comparing the number of misclassifications in each. Lesson 20: Where Do I Belong? We can identify groups, or \u201cclusters,\u201d in data based on a few characteristics. For example, it is easy to classify a classroom into males and females, but what if you only knew each student\u2019s arm span? How well could you classify their genders now? Lesson 21: Our Class Network Networks are made when observations are interconnected. In a social setting, we can examine how different people are connected by finding relationships between other people in a network.","title":"Essential Concepts"},{"location":"unit4/essential/#ids-unit-4-essential-concepts","text":"","title":"IDS Unit 4: Essential Concepts"},{"location":"unit4/essential/#lesson-1-water-usage","text":"Data can be used to make predictions.

Directions: Follow along with the slides and answer the questions in bold font in your journal. How to make predictions Anyone can make predictions. \u2013 Data scientists use data to inform their predictions by using the information learned from the sample to make predictions for the whole population. In this lab, we'll learn how to make predictions by finding the line of best-fit . \u2013 You will also learn how to use the information from one variable to make predictions about another variable. Predicting heights Use the data() function to load the arm_span data. This data comes from a sample of 90 people in the Los Angeles area. \u2013 The measurements of height and armspan are in inches. \u2013 A person's armspan is the maximum distance between their fingertips when they spread their arms out wide. Make a plot of the height variable. \u2013 If you had to predict the height of someone in the LA area, what single height would you choose and why? \u2013 Would you describe this as a good guess? What might you try to improve your predictions? Predicting heights knowing arm spans Create two subsets of our arm_span data: \u2013 One for armspan >= 61 & armspan <= 63 . \u2013 A second for armspan >= 64 & armspan <= 66 . Create a histogram for the height of people in each subset. Answer the following based on the data: \u2013 What height would you predict if you knew a person had an armspan around 62 inches? \u2013 What height would you predict if you knew a person had an armspan around 65 inches? \u2013 Does knowing someone's armspan help you predict their height. Why or why not? Fitting lines Notice that there is a trend that people with a larger armspan also tend to have a larger mean height . \u2013 One way of describing this sort of trend is with a line. Data scientists often fit lines to their data to make predictions. \u2013 What we mean by fit is to come up with a line that's close to as many of the data points as possible. Create a scatterplot for height and armspan . Then run the following code. Draw a line by clicking twice on the Plot pane. add_line() Predicting with lines Draw a line that you think is a good fit and write down its equation. Using this equation: \u2013 Predict how tall a person with a 62 and a person with a 65 inch armspan would be. Using a line to make predictions also lets us make predictions for armspan s that aren't in our data. \u2013 How tall would you predict a person with a 63.5 inch armspan to be?

Predictions In the previous two labs, we learned how to: \u2013 Create a linear model predicting height from the arm_span data (4A). \u2013 See how well our model predicts height on the arm_span data by computing mean squared error (MSE)(4B). In this lab, we will see how well our model predicts the heights of people we haven't yet measured . To do this, we will use a method called cross-validation . Cross-validation consists of three steps: \u2013 Step 1: Split the data into training and test sets. \u2013 Step 2: Create a model using the training set. \u2013 Step 3: Use this model to make predictions on the test set. Step 1: train-test split Waiting for new observations can take a long time. The U.S. takes a census of its population once every 10 years, for example. Instead of waiting for new observations, data scientists will take their current data and divide it into two distinct sets. Split the arm_span data into training and testing data sets using the following steps. First, fill in the blanks below to randomly select which rows of arm_span will go into the training set. set.seed(123) train_rows <- sample(1:____, size = 85) Second, use the slice function to create two dataframes: one called train consisting of the train_rows , and another called test consisting of the remaining rows of arm_span . train <- slice(arm_span, ____) test <- slice(____, - ____) Explain these lines of code and describe the train and test data sets. Aside: set.seed() When we split data, we're randomly separating our observations into training and testing sets. \u2013 It's important to notice that no single observation will be placed in both sets. Because we're splitting the data sets randomly, our models can also vary slightly, person-to-person. \u2013 This is why it's important to use set.seed . By using set.seed , we're able to reproduce the random splitting so that each person's model outputs the same results. Whenever you split data into training and testing, always use set.seed first. Aside: train-test ratio When splitting data into training and testing sets, we need to have enough observations in our data so that we can build a good model. \u2013 This is why we kept 85 observations in our training data. As data sets grow larger, we can use a larger proportion of the data to test with. Step 2: train the model Step 2 is to create a linear model relating height and armspan using the training data. Fit a line of best fit model to our training data and assign it the name best_train . Recall that the slope and intercept of our linear model are chosen to minimize MSE. Since the MSE being minimized is from the training data, we can call it training MSE . Step 3: test the model Step 3 is to use the model we built on the training data to make predictions on the test data. Note that we are NOT recomputing the slope and intercept to fit the test data best. We use the same slope and intercept that were computed in step 2. Because we're using the line of best fit , we can use the predict() function we introduced in the last lab to make predictions. \u2013 Fill in the blanks below to add predicted heights to our test data: test <- mutate(test, ____ = predict(best_train, newdata = ____)) Hint: the predict function without the argument newdata will output predictions on the training data. To output predictions on the test data, supply the test data to the newdata argument. Calculate the MSE in the same way as you did in the previous lab (test MSE is simply MSE of the predictions on the test data). Recap Another way to describe the three steps is Step 1: Split the data into training and test sets. Step 2: Choose a slope and intercept that minimize training MSE. Step 3: Using the same slope and intercept from step 2, make predictions on the test set, and use these predictions to compute test MSE. This begs the question, why do we care about test MSE? Why cross-validate? Why go to all this trouble to compute test MSE when we could just compute MSE on the original dataset? When we compute MSE on the original dataset, we are measuring the ability of a model to make predictions on the current batch of data . Relying on a single dataset can lead to models that are so specific to the current batch of data that they're unable to make good predictions for future observations. \u2013 This phenomenon is known as overfitting . By splitting the data into a training and test set, we are hiding a proportion of the data from the model. This emulates future observations, which are unseen. Test MSE estimates the ability of a model to make predictions of future observations . Example of overfitting The following example motivates cross-validation by illustrating the dangers of overfitting. We randomly select 7 points from the arm_span dataset and fit two models: a linear model, and a polynomial model . \u2013 You will learn how to fit a polynomial model in lab 4F. Below is a plot of these 7 training points, and two curves representing the value of height each model would predict given a value of armspan.

Official data sets rely on censuses or random samples and can be used to make generalizations. On the other hand, data from Participatory Sensing campaigns are not random and rely on the sensors, in our case, humans, to be gathered and limits the ability to generalize. Lesson: Ask students to recall that statistics are used to make predictions about population parameters. Project the map found on the Medical Daily website. Inform students that Twitter data was compared to CDC heart disease deaths data on side-by-side maps. Using a Think, Pair, Share ask students to discuss: What is the source of the data on each map? A: Tweets as predicted by Twitter and heart attacks as listed on a death certificate and recorded by the CDC. What do the colors on the map mean? A: On the spectrum from green to red, green means fewer deaths by heart attack and red means a greater number of deaths by heart attacks. How are the maps the same? How are they different? How reliable are the methods used to report these data? A: In the case of the CDC data, we have verifiability (death certificates). On the other hand, the Twitter data predicts based on a person\u2019s word. How scalable are the methods and can they be generalized? A: Official data sets are usually censuses or random samples; they address things at a high level. Participatory Sensing or, in this case the Twitter data, is not random, but addresses things at a personal or local level; however, because it is not a census nor a random sample, it is difficult to be precise about uncertainty or ability to generalize. Quickly share student responses to the discussion. Then, inform them that this unit focuses on data to make predictions. Set the context for the next three lessons. Inform students that they will be delving into the topic of water usage. In California, water usage is extremely important, given that the state has been in an exceptional drought in the second decade of the 21 st century.

Do a quick Whip Around to share some of the students\u2019 responses to the K-L-W . Inform students that they will be learning about water usage in their own neighborhoods. The LADWP data provides information at a high level about some (most) neighborhoods in L.A. Students will investigate how they can learn more using participatory sensing. In statistics, the Data Cycle provides a process by which we can learn about or investigate a particular topic of interest. To review the components of the Data Cycle, give students two minutes to Quick Sketch each phase of the cycle in their DS Journals. After students have had an opportunity to do their sketches, display the Data Cycle graphic below to review it: Next, review their class created campaign from Unit 3 . Using a Pair-Share strategy, ask students to discuss when a Participatory Sensing campaign should be used rather than a survey. A: Answers will vary. Research questions that include variation across time or across locations are good candidates for Participatory Sensing campaigns; therefore, a trigger is necessary in order to record observations at multiple time points and locations. If a question needs to be answered only once, then a survey is a better method. Remind students that in the last unit, they created one campaign for the entire class. In this unit, each student team will be creating and implementing a campaign on the topic of water usage. Before they start creating their campaign, they are going to explore an official data set provided by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) to learn more about water usage in the Los Angeles area. Some students may receive services from the DWP. Explain how the data were collected: The data you will see reflects the water usage in Los Angeles in the fiscal year that began in 2010 (July 2010-June 2011). At this time, L.A. was entering a drought, but water conservation efforts had not yet begun. The DWP supplies water to businesses and addresses within its boundaries. It records the amount of water delivered to each address each month. For privacy purposes, it doesn't report how much water a single address uses. Instead, it combines these into neighborhoods. These neighborhoods are defined by the U.S. Census and called Census Blocks. A census block is usually one, sometimes two, square blocks. The DWP reports separate water usage figures for businesses, government structures (such as schools), and residences. For privacy purposes, this data set eliminated any Census Block that had fewer than 15 addresses. Water use is reported in Hundreds of Cubic Feet (HCF) per month (one HCF is about 748 gallons). Display the picture below, which shows a truck that holds about 6 HCF, so students can get a sense of the amount of water as reported. Load and display the DWP data set in RStudio using the command data(dwp_2010) . Then, expand the spreadsheet ( ) and explain what each variable in the data set means (they may want to record these in their DS journals): census = census block sector_type = category of facility longitude, latitude = GPS coordinates for center of census block location census_pop = population of census block (number of water users) total = total number of HFCs used by sector type per block in 2010 july through june = number of HFCs used by sector type per count = number of facilities per census block for that sector type Next, load an interactive map of the DWP 2010 data by visiting: https://labs.idsucla.org/extras/animations/watermap/watermap.html Lead a discussion about what is on the page. Ask: What do the colors and percentages on the legend mean? What trends do you see? Then click on a marker (circle) to show the popup. Ask: What information is the popup displaying? How is the popup displaying the information? Then, click on the Size by census_pop circle under the legend. Ask: What do you notice about the markers? What is the size of each marker telling us? What else do you see? Now that they know what the variables mean, ask student teams to generate two statistical questions about the data. Below are three examples of possible statistical questions: What month uses the most water? Typically, how much water do residences consume during that month? Does this change if you factor in the number of people living in that census block? If time permits, conduct a share-out of the teams\u2019 statistical questions.

A: Tweets as predicted by Twitter and heart attacks as listed on a death certificate and recorded by the CDC. What do the colors on the map mean? A: On the spectrum from green to red, green means fewer deaths by heart attack and red means a greater number of deaths by heart attacks. How are the maps the same? How are they different?

On the other hand, the Twitter data predicts based on a person\u2019s word. How scalable are the methods and can they be generalized? A: Official data sets are usually censuses or random samples; they address things at a high level. Participatory Sensing or, in this case the Twitter data, is not random, but addresses things at a personal or local level; however, because it is not a census nor a random sample, it is difficult to be precise about uncertainty or ability to generalize. Quickly share student responses to the discussion. Then, inform them that this unit focuses on data to make predictions. Set the context for the next three lessons.

Materials: What\u2019s the Trend? handout ( LMR_4.7_What\u2019s the Trend ) from lesson 8 Predicting Values handout ( LMR_4.10_Predicting Values ) Vocabulary: observed value, predicted value Essential Concepts: Essential Concepts: The regression line can be used to make good predictions about values of y for any given value of x . This works for exactly the same reason the mean works well for one variable: the predictions will make your score on the mean squared residuals as small as possible. Lesson: Entrance ticket: How do you find the equation of a line using two points? Note to Teacher: Students may share their responses with a partner or you may choose to use this ticket as an assessment. Reveal the equation of the line of best fit for the Arm Span vs. Height data and ask students to check their equations from the homework assignment: Note: Any time a hat is on top of a variable, this means we are making \u201cpredicted values\u201d of that variable. Whose equation came closest to the equation of the regression line? Ask the student whose equation came closest to share how he/she came up with the equation. Inform students that the equation of the line is a rule that predicts the height based on a second variable, in this case, arm span. Team discussion question: Using the equation of the line of best fit provided, how can we predict the height of a student whose arm span is 67 inches? Remind students that lines of best fit are also known as regression lines and they are models that can be used to make predictions. Today, they will explore more about this line. Ask student teams to refer back to What\u2019s the Trend? Handout ( LMR_4.7 ). They should discuss the following questions and record their responses on the Predicting Values handout ( LMR_4.10 ): LMR_4.10 What do you notice about where the points are and where the line is? Some points are near the line, others are further away, and one point is exactly on the line. Data points are observed values and points on the line are predicted values . Recall from Algebra that every line can be represented by an equation in the form y=mx+b. In this case, the equation of the regression line is y=3.2536x+154.3654. What do the x- and y-values represent in this equation? The x-values represent the number of explosions and the y-values represent the predicted profit. According to the equation, what is the slope of this line? What does the slope mean in relation to the number of explosions? The slope is 3.2536. It is the rate of change between the number of explosions and the profit. It means that for every explosion increase the profit increases by 3.2536 dollars. When the number of explosions (x-value) is zero, what is the profit (y-value)? How do you know? What does this mean? The profit is 154.3654 million dollars. Students may use the equation to show that they substituted zero for x, so the y-intercept is the profit. It means that if Michael Bay were to make a movie with NO explosions, this would be his projected profit. If you wanted to know the profit for the point that lies the closest to the line, what would the equation be? Write the equation and solve it. Profit=3.2536(211)+154.3654. Profit=840.875 or 840,875,000 million dollars. What was the actual profit for the point that lies closest to the line? The actual profit was 836,303,693 million dollars. What if Michael Bay made a movie that had 325 explosions? What would his predicted profit be? Show how you arrived at the solution. By substituting 325 in the value of x in the equation, predicted profit will be $1,211, 785, 400 or $ 1, 211.7854, or by finding the point on the line or both.

A value close to 0 means a weak linear trend. Lesson: Inform students that, so far, they have been labeling associations as strong, very strong, or weak. A number called the correlation coefficient measures strength of association. The correlation coefficient only applies to linear relationships, which must be checked visually with a scatterplot. Later we will learn how to calculate this number using RStudio. Note to teacher: Advance preparation is needed for this lesson. Each team needs one envelope with cutouts of plots A-F in LMR_4.11 (Part A). Make envelopes according to the number of teams in the class. This process will be repeated for LMR_4.11 (Part B). Distribute the envelopes to the teams. Students will examine the strength of association in each plot.

Ask a volunteer to think of a TV show that had a \u201cspinoff\u201d and to name both of the shows. Ask if he/she knows whether or not the original was more or less successful than the spinoff. Then, ask the class: Is there a way to predict spinoff success? Next, using the Talking to the Text instructional strategy, ask students to read the article titled: How Long Can a Spinoff Like Better Call Saul Last? Note: If this is the first time using this strategy with your students, make sure you model/explain it before they begin reading it. See Instructional Strategies in Teacher Resources for a description. After reading the article, ask students to discuss three Talking to the Text responses with a partner. You may set a time limit for each student to share with his/her partner. Then, in teams, students will answer the following questions pertaining to the article: What is the article trying to predict? How many variables are used? What other variables might affect a spinoff? The dotted line in the plot is not a regression line. How would you draw a regression line to make predictions? What other information would you like to know to predict a spinoff\u2019s success? Allow students time to discuss and record their answers. Then conduct a share out of their responses to the discussion questions. Discuss the following questions with the class: What effect does advertising have on retail sales? Where do stores advertise (What mediums do they use)? Does each method of advertisement reach the same people? Does each method of advertisement have a similar effect? Or are some methods more effective than others? Distribute the 3 plots from the Advertising Plots Part 1 handout ( LMR_4.12 ) and inform the students about the data using the details below: (Plots are presented separately in the LMR) LMR_4.12 These 3 plots show the number of items sold by a retailer (in 200 different markets) and the amount of money the company spent on TV , Radio and Newspaper advertisements. The data has 200 observations, one for each different market. A market is simply a location where an item is sold. For example, Los Angeles and San Francisco are two different markets. Each observation has 4 variables: (1) The number of items sold (in 10\u2019s of thousands of units), (2) the money spent on TV ads (in thousands of dollars), (3) the money spent on radio ads (in thousands of dollars), and (4) the money spent on newspaper ads (in thousands of dollars). The data were collected using an observational study. To illustrate a-d above, ask students to refer to plot A (TV ads) and circle the market in which this retailer sold the least number of items (see circles in plots above). Ask: How many items did this market sell? About 20,000 items. The actual number of items sold was 1.6 (in 10,000\u2019s of units) which is 16,000 items. How much money did this retailer spend on TV ads in this market? This retailer spent zero dollars on TV ads. The actual amount the retailer spent on TV ads was 0.7 thousands of dollars, which is $700. Students should then refer to plot B (Radio ads), find the same market (the one in which the retailer sold about 20,000 items) and circle it. Ask: How much money did the retailer spend on Radio ads in the same market? About 40 thousand dollars. The actual amount spent on Radio ads was 39.6 thousands of dollars, which is $39,600. Finally, ask students to refer to plot C (Newspaper ads), find the same market (the one in which the retailer sold about 20,000 items), and circle it. Ask: How much money did the retailer spend on Newspaper ads in the same market? About 10 thousand dollars. About The actual amount spent on Newspaper ads is 8.7 thousands of dollars, which is $8,700 Based on the above plots, use a Pair-Share to discuss the following: Describe the relationship between advertisements and the number of items sold. Which type of advertisement is the most strongly correlated with the number of units sold? How can you tell? Distribute the Advertising Plots Part 2 handout ( LMR_4.13_Advertising Plots 2 ), which contains plots A-C, but now include the line of best fit. (Plots are presented separately in the LMR) LMR_4.13 Ask students to recall from Lesson 6 that a method statisticians use to figure out which predicted values is closest to the actual data is the mean absolute error (MAE). Note to teacher: In the labs, students will use the mean squared error (MSE) - also learned in Lesson 6 - which calculates the regression line. In the lessons, we discuss the issue more generally using the mean absolute error (MAE). In teams, ask students to discuss the following: How would you use the mean absolute error to determine which plot would make the most accurate predictions? Answers will vary, but you would expect to hear something like: \u201cthe prediction line that has the least amount of distance to all the points on the plot would make the most accurate prediction because the predicted values will be closer to the actual data.\u201d Next, have students select a statement they think is best (a or b), then write a justification for their selection based on what they learned in this lesson. This may be completed as homework. Combining multiple variables (e.g., TV and Newspaper ads, TV and Radio ads, TV, Radio, and Newspaper ads, etc.) into one model will lead to worse predictions because the variables that make poor predictions will contaminate those that make good predictions. Combining multiple variables (e.g., TV and Newspaper ads, TV and Radio ads, TV, Radio, and Newspaper ads, etc.) into one model will lead to better predictions because the model can use more information to make predictions. Inform students that RStudio has the capability of creating models that combine multiple variables to make predictions about another variable. For example, it can make a model to predict number of items sold using both money spent on TV and money spent on Newspaper ads. Students will learn more about it during the next lesson . Class Scribes: One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.

Then they will wrestle with how the information should be combined. Materials: Advertising Plots Part 2 handout ( LMR_4.13_Advertising Plots 2 ) from Lesson 12 Essential Concepts: Essential Concepts: If multiple predictors are associated with the response variable, a better predictive model will be produced, as measured by the mean absolute error. Lesson: Display the plots and statements from the previous day: LMR_4.13 Combining multiple variables (e.g., money spent on TV and Newspaper ads, TV and Radio ads, TV, Radio, and Newspaper ads, etc.) into one model will lead to worse predictions because the variables that make poor predictions will contaminate those that make good predictions. Combining multiple variables (e.g., TV and Newspaper ads, TV and Radio ads, TV, Radio, and Newspaper ads, etc.) into one model will lead to better predictions because the model can use more information to make predictions. Ask the students to share out their opinions in an Active Debate (see Unit 2 Lesson 6 as an example). Next, inform teams that they will have 2 minutes to come up with as many combinations of ads (variables) as they can think of (e.g., TV + Newspaper ads, TV+ Radio ads, TV + Radio + Newspaper ads, etc.) After 2 minutes, list all the different combinations by conducting a Whip Around and eliciting a combination from each team. By a show of hands, ask students to select which combination or single model will be the best predictor for the number of items sold by the retailer. Then inform students that we will determine which of the statements is true by comparing the mean absolute error (MAE) of single models (like the ones we showed in the previous lesson) vs. combined models. But first, use the line of best fit for the combined variables: Note: The function that produced the line of best fit using RStudio was lm(Sales ~ TV + Radio + Newspaper, data= retail) Use this equation to predict the amount of sales for the same market they circled in the previous lesson. Students\u2019 calculation should yield the predicted value in (b), below. Note: Remind students that they need to substitute the values as they appear in the x-axis of the plots without converting to thousands of dollars. For example, the circled market spent about 10 thousand dollars on newspaper ads, so students should substitute 10 instead of the expanded value in the equation. Does the predicted value (10.407) seem like a plausible number of sales? Why? It is not a plausible number of sales because the prediction is too high. The prediction says the retailer will sell about 104,070 units, when the actual sales were about 16,000 units. Although the model did not make a very good prediction for this market, it is not surprising because as LMR_4.13 displays, that market did not fit the overall pattern in any of the scatterplots. Reveal that RStudio calculated the mean absolute error for different combinations plus the single models, and the results are displayed on the table below. This means that, for example, when using the TV model to predict number of items sold, our predictions will typically be off by about 2.337808 (in 10,000s) of units or 23,378 units. Then ask students: Model Mean Absolute Error TV 2.337808 Radio 3.565113 Newspaper 4.538444 TV-Radio 1.160937 TV-Newspaper 2.344971 Radio-Newspaper 2.93832 TV-Radio-Newspaper 1.161068 Which model is the best predictor of number of items sold? Answer: The TV-Radio model is the best predictor of number of items sold because it had the least amount of error, on average. When using the TV-Radio model to predict number of items sold, our predictions will typically be off by 11,609 units. Which model was the least reliable in predicting the number of items sold? Answer: The Newspaper model is the least reliable predictor of number of items sold because it had the most amount of error, on average. When using the Newspaper model to predict number of items sold, our predictions will typically be off by 45,384 units. What else do you notice about the models? Answer: It appears that combining the variables into one model is much better than any of the single-variable models. Inform the students that, in the next lab, they will find out how to create the line of best fit for models that include many variables. Class Scribes: One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were. Homework & Next Day Ask students to think of a reason or reasons about why it would not be a good idea to make a scatterplot for models that include more than 3 predictor variables? The answer is mainly because humans are limited to seeing things in 3 dimensions. For example, the model that combines all of the variables together is a 4 dimensional model.

Materials: Describe the Association handout ( LMR_4.14_Describe the Association ) Vocabulary: non-linear, polynomial trends Essential Concepts: Essential Concepts: If a linear model is fit to a non-linear trend, it will not do a good job of predicting. For this reason, we need to identify non-linear trends by looking at a scatterplot or the model needs to match the trend. Lesson: Remind students that they have been learning a great deal about linear associations. However, there are other types of associations, and today they will learn to describe them. Distribute Describe the Association ( LMR_4.14 ). In teams, students will examine the trend of each plot. Their task is to write a description of the trend that they see in the data and what the trend means. LMR_4.14 Allow students time to discuss and record their descriptions for each plot in their DS journals. Walk around the room monitoring student teamwork. Look for descriptions that are interesting to share with the whole class. Select a team to present a description of one plot to the class. Teams will listen to each presentation, compare it to their description of the plot, and as a team they will agree or disagree. If there is disagreement, lead a discussion that guides students to reason toward the correct description. Summarize the discussion for each plot and ask students take notes or revise their descriptions in their DS journals. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for the rest of the plots. Plot Descriptions for Describe the Association ( LMR_4.14 ): Plot A: There is no trend (perhaps some may see a very, very weak linear trend), so there is no/hardly any association. There is a great deal of scatter in the data. It means that y does not depend on x. Plot B: There appears to be a linear trend. The association is negative and appears somewhat strong. It means that as x increases, y decreases. Plot C: There is a linear trend. The association is positive and it is very strong. It means that the y-value increases at approximately the same rate for every increase in x value. This is a line. Plot D: The trend is non-linear. There seems to be a weak association because there is scatter in the data. Cannot tell if the association is positive or negative. It has the shape of a parabola; therefore, it is quadratic. For smaller x-values, the y-value is decreasing and for larger x values, the y value is increasing. Plot E: The trend is non-linear. There seems to be a strong association because there is little scatter in the data. It is also in the shape of a parabola, so it is quadratic. Using the Cheat Notes strategy, ask teams to write notes about how to describe associations. Plots A, B, and C should be familiar to the students by now. However, plots D and E show a different type of trend. Although the trends are non-linear, they can still tell us important information about the y-values based on values of x. Ask: What happens if we were to fit a linear model to these non-linear trends? Would it still make good predictions? No. They would not make good predictors. To examine why they would not make good predictors, draw an approximate linear best-fit line and get students to understand that in some regions, the model would almost always over-predict, and in others would almost always under-predict. We want a model that goes, more or less, through the 'middle' of the points. Ask: How can we get a model that goes, more or less, through the middle of all the data points? Answer: We need to change the model. Trends like the quadratic ones show in plots D and E can be described as polynomial trends . Plots that follow quadratic, cubic, quartic, etc. shapes all exhibit polynomial trends. We need to adjust the model. You may show students several choices of equations (quadratic, trinomial, linear) along with their graphs and ask them which might be a good candidate.

They will engage in an activity to see how making slight changes to the tree can lead to drastic rises or reductions in misclassifications. Materials: CART Activity Player Stats ( LMR_4.19_CART Player Stats ) CART Activity Round 1 Questions ( LMR_4.20_CART Round 1 ) CART Activity Round 2 Questions ( LMR_4.21_CART Round 2 ) Advanced preparation required (see Step 8 below) Vocabulary: classify, decision tree, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), nodes, misclassifications Essential Concepts: Essential Concepts: Some trends are not linear, so the approaches we\u2019ve done so far won\u2019t be helpful. We need to model such trends differently. Decision trees are a non-linear tool for classifying observations into groups when the trend is non-linear. Lesson: Inform students that, during today\u2019s lesson, they will be participating in an activity to try to classify professional athletes into one of two groups: (1) soccer players on the US Men\u2019s National Team, OR (2) football players in the National Football League (NFL). Remind students that this unit has focused on linear models and making predictions. In the real world, data can be modeled in a variety of ways, many of which are non-linear, and because of this, we can\u2019t easily write down a mathematical equation to help us make predictions. However, we can use what we have learned so far to determine whether or not other models can provide a good fit to the data. Introduce the topic of decision trees and explain that it is simply a non-linear way to model data. Explain that decision trees are \u201cgrown\u201d by using algorithms, or rules, to test many, many different decision trees to find the one that makes the best predictions. A decision tree is basically a series of questions that are asked sequentially. Observations start by answering the first question (at the root of the tree), and then proceed along the different branches based on the answers they give to the questions that follow. At the end, based on all of the questions asked, observations are then classified as one of k classifications. Remind students that algorithms are a series of steps that are repeated a large number of times. For decision trees, this enables us to (1) explore many possible paths, beginning from the same initial point, or (2) find different starting points based on where we ended during the previous iteration. Ask students to recall that they created and worked with linear models earlier in the unit. We are continuing our work with models and will learn another method of modeling called CART , which stands for Classification and Regression Trees . This is another name for decision trees. CART Activity: to get a sense of how decision trees work, the students will see one in action. We are going to try to classify 15 professional athletes into either soccer or football players based on some of their characteristics. Note: Advanced preparation required. The cards in each of the LMRs listed above (and displayed below) need to be cut out prior to class time. LMR_4.19 LMR_4.20 LMR_4.21 Ask for 15 volunteers and hand each of them a data card from the CART Activity Player Stats handout ( LMR_4.19 ). These students will be known as the \u201cplayers.\u201d Each card lists the following variables for 15 different professional athletes: a. team location b. name c. age d. height (in inches) e. weight (in pounds) f. league The \u201cplayers\u201d will only be allowed to say \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d in this activity. No other talking is permitted. Now, ask for 7 additional volunteers to be the nodes , or leaves , on the decision tree. Each student will be known as a \u201cleaf.\u201d Distribute one question/classification from the CART Activity Round 1 Questions ( LMR_4.20 ) to each \u201cleaf.\u201d Arrange the 7 \u201cleaves\u201d in the room as depicted by the graphic below: Now, each \u201cplayer,\u201d one at a time, will approach Leaf 1 , who will ask the \u201cplayer\u201d the question listed on his/her card. Depending on the player\u2019s answer, Leaf 1 will direct the \u201cplayer\u201d to the next \u201cleaf.\u201d The \u201cplayer\u201d continues through the nodes until a \u201cleaf\u201d declares the \u201cplayer\u201d to be either (1) a soccer player on the US Men\u2019s National Team, OR (2) a football player in the National Football League (NFL). Allow all the \u201cplayers\u201d to go through the \u201cleaves\u201d until each one is classified as either a soccer or football player. After each player has been classified, tally the number of correct and incorrect classifications and display a simple table (see example below) on the board. Classified Correctly Classified Incorrectly USMNT Soccer Player ? ? NFL Football Player ? ? Ask students to calculate the misclassification rate (MCR) which is the proportion of observations who were predicted to be in one category but were actually in another. If all the activity player stats cards were used, the misclassification rate would be 5/15. After proceeding through \u201cRound 1,\u201d ask an additional 5 students to come up as more \u201cleaves,\u201d distribute the cards from the CART Activity Round 2 Questions file ( LMR_4.21 ), and arrange the students like the diagram below: Have each \u201cplayer\u201d go through this new set of \u201cleaves\u201d until they are re-classified by these new rules. Again, tally the number of correct and incorrect classifications and display them on the board and calculate the misclassification rate. If all the activity player stats cards were used, the misclassification rate would be 3/15. Once the activity has been completed, ask students the following questions: How do decision trees classify objects/people as being a member of a group? By asking a series of questions, one at a time, and sending the participant down a particular path until he/she is classified. Did we do as well, worse, or better in Round 2 compared to Round 1 at correctly guessing which sport the \u201cplayers\u201d participate in? Explain. Answers will vary according to results of the activity. How can we figure out what questions to ask and in what order to minimize the number of misclassifications ? (This one might not be obvious. The point is for the students to wrestle with how they might think it can be done.) Also have the students discuss the following questions: How is a decision tree/CART similar to or different than a linear model? Can we really call a decision tree a model? Why or why not? In lab 4G you will use RStudio to create tree models that will make good predictions without needing a lot of branches. RStudio can also calculate the misclassification rate. However, you might find the visual a little confusing to interpret, so we will use the Round 2 classification tree to see what the output from RStudio might look like. Project the image above and explain to the students that if all 15 of the activity player stats cards were used, then RStudio would give ratios for each of the leaves where a classification was made. The denominator tells us how many observations ended up in that leaf and the numerator tells us the number of misclassifications. Ask students: What does the output 3/9 represent? Answer: The 9 tells us that nine players were classified as NFL players based solely on the fact that they were taller than 74 inches. The 3 represents soccer players that were misclassified so 6 football players were classified correctly. How would you calculate the misclassification rate (MCR)? Answer: You would add all of the numerators which represent the misclassifications and divide by the total number of observations which you could obtain by adding all the denominators. (3+0+0)/(9+1+5)=3/15. Class Scribes: One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.

Objective: Students will learn what clustering is and how to classify groups of people into clusters based on unknown similarities. Materials: Find the Clusters handout ( LMR_4.24_Find the Clusters ) Vocabulary: clustering, cluster, k-means Essential Concepts: Essential Concepts: We can identify groups, or \u201cclusters,\u201d in data based on a few characteristics. For example, it is easy to classify a classroom into males and females, but what if you only knew each person\u2019s arm span? How well could you classify their genders now? Lesson: Inform the students that they will continue to explore different types of models, and today they will be focusing on clustering . Clustering is the process of grouping a set of objects (or people) together in such a way that people in the same group (called a cluster ) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. Have the students recall that, in the previous lessons, they used decision trees and CART to classify people into different groups based on whether or not a person had a specific characteristic (e.g., whether or not a professional athlete\u2019s team is based in the US). But, sometimes we don\u2019t know what these specific characteristics are. We are simply given numerical variables and asked to find similarities. This is where clustering comes in \u2013 similar people will congregate towards each other, and we want to see if we can identify their groupings. We will look at a very basic example first. Suppose the following 6 observations are given: Obs X 1 X 2 1 160 74 2 165 72 3 165 74 4 175 68 5 180 70 6 185 72 Plot the X 1 and X 2 points on a scatterplot either on the board or on poster paper (X 1 can be on the horizontal axis and X 2 can be on the vertical axis). The graph should look like the one below: Ask students if they think there are any clusters, or groups, that stand out to them. It is likely that they will say there are 2 clusters in the graph: the top left corner 3 points, and the bottom right 3 points. Now pose the following scenario that further describes the data: A doctor provides yearly physicals to the men\u2019s football and men\u2019s swimming teams at a local high school. He has collected data over the past few years on each player\u2019s weight (in pounds) and height (in inches). He informs us that weight was coded as the variable X 1 , and height was coded as the variable X 2 . You can re-label the scatterplot with this new information. Unfortunately, the doctor never recorded what sport each person played. Using the information about height and weight, ask the students to decide: Which group of points most likely represents players from the swimming team? The points in the upper left corner are probably swimmers because swimmers are usually tall (and have large arm spans) and thin. Which group of points most likely represents players from the football team? The points in the bottom right corner are probably football players because they tend to be heavier and more muscular. Now suppose a new player comes into the doctor\u2019s office for a physical. His weight and height are recorded as 166 pounds and 73 inches, respectively, but the doctor forgets to ask what sport he plays. Plot this point on the graph and ask students to determine which sport they think this student plays. This student is most likely a swimmer because he is tall and thin, and his point is near the swimming cluster. That was an easy one! But what if a player comes in and has the following measurements: weight = 173 pounds, height = 73 inches? Distribute the Find the Clusters handout ( LMR_4.24 ) and tell the students that the new point has been added to the \u201cRound 1\u201d graph. LMR_4.24 Ask students: On which team do you think this person plays? It is much more difficult to tell now because it looks like it is right in between the two clusters. In order to determine group placement, we can use an algorithm called k-means clustering . With this method, we select k clusters that we want to identify. Since we know we only have 2 types of athletes, football players and swimmers, we will be finding k = 2 clusters. To introduce the students to this idea, circle the 3 points in the upper left corner (the ones that are likely the swimmers) and have students find the \u201cmean point.\u201d This means that they should find the mean x-value and the mean y-value of the 3 points. They can then plot this new point and use it as the mean of this particular group, or cluster. The goal of this algorithm is to keep recalculating means as the possible clusters change. To begin, we will randomly pick 2 arbitrary points on the plot (we can call them A and B) to be our starting means for each cluster. There is no incorrect way to pick the starting means, but the further away the means are from the actual points, the longer it will take the algorithm to complete. If you would like to use the point found in Step 14 and label it as \u201cA,\u201d that is completely fine. You can simply pick just one other random point and label it as \u201cB.\u201d For now, we will start with the following two points as guesses for the means of each group: A: (170, 70) and B: (175, 74). In the \u201cRound 1\u201d plot on the Find the Clusters handout, each student should plot and label these two points. Inform the students that they will be drawing lines from each original point to both means. Then, they will decide if the point is closer to mean A or mean B and label the point with that letter. Lines have been draw from the top left point to the means in the plot below as a guide. You can draw this on the board as a reference for the students as well. Since the line to point A is smaller, we would classify that point as being in cluster A (as shown below). The students should draw similar lines for every point on the graph and make a decision as to which cluster each belongs in. They can simply eyeball it. Even if they guess incorrectly, the algorithm should be able to find the correct groups after some time. The correct classifications for Round 1 are as follows: Once the class has agreed on the first round\u2019s cluster classifications, they should compute new values for the k-means (A and B). For mean A, they simply need to find the mean x-value for the 4 points and the mean y-value for the 4 points. The new means for A and B have been calculated below. The students should be calculating these on their own and recording their new means on the handout. x-value for A = (160 + 165 + 165 + 175)/4 = 166.25 y-value for A = (74 + 72 + 74 + 68)/4 = 72 x-value for B = (173 + 180 + 185)/3 = 179.3 y-value for B = (73 + 70 + 72)/3 = 71.67 new A = (166.25, 72) new B = (179.3, 71.67) Have the students continue working through the handout until the cluster membership remains the same between 2 consecutive rounds. This means that, from one iteration to the next, the points in each cluster do not change.

The students should be calculating these on their own and recording their new means on the handout. x-value for A = (160 + 165 + 165 + 175)/4 = 166.25 y-value for A = (74 + 72 + 74 + 68)/4 = 72 x-value for B = (173 + 180 + 185)/3 = 179.3 y-value for B = (73 + 70 + 72)/3 = 71.67 new A = (166.25, 72) new B = (179.3, 71.67) Have the students continue working through the handout until the cluster membership remains the same between 2 consecutive rounds. This means that, from one iteration to the next, the points in each cluster do not change.","title":"Lesson:"},{"location":"unit4/lesson20/#class-scribes","text":"One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.","title":"Class Scribes:"},{"location":"unit4/lesson20/#homework-next-day","text":"Write a paragraph that describes k-means clustering in your own words.

Lesson: Display the Friend Network Graphic ( LMR_4.25 ), which shows a WolframAlpha visualization of someone\u2019s Facebook friends. Inform the students that this type of model is called a network , which is simply a group of people or things that are interconnected in some way. LMR_4.25 Ask the following questions about the graphic: What does each dot represent? Each dot represents one person. What does each line represent? Each line represents a friendship between two people. How are all the people in this graphic connected to each other? They are all friends with the person whose Facebook this is. Why are some areas denser than others? A lot of people in the darker spots know each other, so there are more connections/friendships. Why are some people not in groups at all (the dots at the edges of the graphic)? The main person does not have any friends in common with this person. What might some of the groupings (the denser spots) represent? Answers will vary. Some examples include high school friends, college friends, graduate school friends, family members, or people who participate in similar hobbies. Ask the students what other types of social networks, other than Facebook, they belong to? Responses will most likely include TikTok, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, LinkedIn, Google+, etc. Next, inform the students that networks can be as big or as small as we want. We can even determine our own class\u2019s social network and create visualizations from it! Network Activity: Distribute index cards to students. Each student will need enough cards to make a connection with every other person in the class. For example, if there are 20 students in a class, then each student needs 19 cards. On EVERY index card, the student should write his/her first AND last name in the lower left-hand corner (see image below). Next, each student will walk around the classroom and put another student\u2019s first AND last name in the top right-hand corner of an index card (see image below). In the center of the index card, the students should write the name of the closest 3 rd person that they BOTH know (see image below). The person can be someone in the class, someone outside of the class, or someone who doesn\u2019t even attend the same school. Once all of the students have completed their cards, they will turn them in to the teacher so the teacher can create a visualization of the network. This will probably take an entire class period to complete, which is fine because the graphics can be created and shown the next day. At this point, the teacher will need to manually input the data from the index cards into a spreadsheet. It is recommended that the spreadsheet be saved as a .csv file. Two sample index cards are included, along with how you would input the data. Note: The first index card corresponds to rows 1 and 2 in the spreadsheet (the purple box). The second index card corresponds to rows 3 and 4 in the spreadsheet (the pink box). So, each card will take up two rows in the spreadsheet. Note: It is probably best to input the data after class and present the visualization during the next day.

Round 4: Now that the teams have decided on a trigger and the type of data needed, they will discuss and create survey questions/prompts to ask when the trigger is set. The questions should consider all of the possible data they might collect at this trigger event. Once teams have created their survey questions/prompts, they will evaluate each survey question. For each question they should consider: What type of survey question/prompt will this be (e.g. single choice, text, photo, numerical, discrete numerical, categorical, location)? How does this question/prompt help address the research question? Does the question/prompt need to be reworded? (Is it clear what is being asked for? Do they know how to answer it?) One way to do this is to pair teams and take turns asking each other prompts. The team that is being asked may explain what information they think the question is asking for.

They will consider different measures of success. Materials: Heights of Students at a Large High School handout ( LMR_4.4_HS Student Heights ) Vocabulary: rule Essential Concepts: Essential Concepts: Anyone can make a prediction. But statisticians measure the success of their predictions. This lesson encourages the classroom to consider different measures of success. Lesson: Inform the class that for this lesson, our class will help judge a contest held at a particular high school. This school held a contest in which they selected students at random from a classroom and reported their height. The information in Steps 3 \u2013 7 is included in the Heights of Students at a Large High School handout ( LMR_4.4 ). LMR_4.4 They gave all of the students the data for the first 20 selected students, but you will not see these data! Each student was asked to predict the heights of the last 10 students. Here is the catch: students were allowed to give only ONE number that had to be used to predict all 10 heights. Three student teams made predictions about the height of the last 10 students. The judges of this contest want you to tell them how they should determine the winner. Your team\u2019s job is to determine the winning team, the team that came in second place, and the team that came in third place. Your team must come up with two things: You must support your choice of a winner by using a rule for calculating a total score for each team. The rule must be applied to each team\u2019s prediction to determine their placement and your team must be able to explain how your rule helped select the winner. You must write instructions to the judges that explain how to use your rule to select a winner. For example, do they choose the team with the largest score? The smallest? Here are the predictions of the three teams: Team A: 69 inches Team B: 70 inches Team C: 66 inches Display Plot A, found on page 2 of the Heights of Students at a High School handout ( LMR_4.4 ). This dotplot displays the heights shown in the Actual Outcome column of the table. Inform students that this dotplot and table is provided to help them come up with a method to determine a winner. The table is to visualize the predicted heights side-by-side with the randomly selected heights. Notes to teacher: Students may have to be reminded that negative values with large absolute value are larger than positive values with small absolute values (e.g., 10 is larger than 3). Let students struggle for a little bit. A prompt to get them started: Look at the difference between a team's prediction and the actual outcomes (e.g., for the first height, Team A predicted 69, actual outcome was 63, so 69-63=6). They might also need to be nudged towards the sum of these differences \u2013 they need to produce a single score, not 10 separate scores. Here are some rules you can \u201cfeed\u201d to the class to move them along. Ask them (a) Describe this rule in words. (b) Is it better to get a high score or a low score or some other score? (c) Which teams win for each? (Note, some of these rules produce ties). Rule 1: sum(heights-predicted.value == 0) words: the number of exactly correct predictions Rule 2: sum(heights-predicted.value) words: the sum of the differences between predicted value and the actual heights Rule 3: sum(abs(heights-estimate)) words: the sum of the absolute values of the deviations Rule 4: sum((heights-estimate)^2) words: the sum of the squared deviations Note: It is unlikely that students will think of the last two. That\u2019s okay, because we will introduce them in a future lesson, but you might want to present one (or both) to see what they think about these rules. Allow student teams time to discuss and complete the task for Plot A. Do not share their responses to Plot A. Instead, display the following questions: What if we had a different set of 10 randomly selected students and plotted their heights? Would the same team win? Allow teams to discuss the questions, then share a couple of responses to the questions in the previous step. Display Plot B, found on page 2 of the Heights of Students at a High School handout ( LMR_4.4 ), then have them find the winner using this new sample. Is it the same as they chose before? Note: We do NOT know the value of the true population mean/typical value. This is what we are really trying to predict. Teams will take turns to share their work as follows: Which team did you select as the winner using Plot A? Explain the method, or rule , your team used to declare the winner. Which team did you select as the winner using Plot B? Is the winner the same? Did you use the same rule to select a winner or did it change? If it changed, explain. During the share out, students will take notes about the other teams\u2019 rules in their DS journals. Teams may continue to share at the start of the next lesson , if they run out of time.

LMR_4.4 They gave all of the students the data for the first 20 selected students, but you will not see these data! Each student was asked to predict the heights of the last 10 students. Here is the catch: students were allowed to give only ONE number that had to be used to predict all 10 heights. Three student teams made predictions about the height of the last 10 students. The judges of this contest want you to tell them how they should determine the winner. Your team\u2019s job is to determine the winning team, the team that came in second place, and the team that came in third place. Your team must come up with two things: You must support your choice of a winner by using a rule for calculating a total score for each team. The rule must be applied to each team\u2019s prediction to determine their placement and your team must be able to explain how your rule helped select the winner. You must write instructions to the judges that explain how to use your rule to select a winner. For example, do they choose the team with the largest score? The smallest? Here are the predictions of the three teams: Team A: 69 inches Team B: 70 inches Team C: 66 inches Display Plot A, found on page 2 of the Heights of Students at a High School handout ( LMR_4.4 ). This dotplot displays the heights shown in the Actual Outcome column of the table. Inform students that this dotplot and table is provided to help them come up with a method to determine a winner. The table is to visualize the predicted heights side-by-side with the randomly selected heights. Notes to teacher: Students may have to be reminded that negative values with large absolute value are larger than positive values with small absolute values (e.g., 10 is larger than 3). Let students struggle for a little bit. A prompt to get them started: Look at the difference between a team's prediction and the actual outcomes (e.g., for the first height, Team A predicted 69, actual outcome was 63, so 69-63=6). They might also need to be nudged towards the sum of these differences \u2013 they need to produce a single score, not 10 separate scores. Here are some rules you can \u201cfeed\u201d to the class to move them along. Ask them (a) Describe this rule in words. (b) Is it better to get a high score or a low score or some other score? (c) Which teams win for each? (Note, some of these rules produce ties). Rule 1: sum(heights-predicted.value == 0) words: the number of exactly correct predictions Rule 2: sum(heights-predicted.value) words: the sum of the differences between predicted value and the actual heights Rule 3: sum(abs(heights-estimate)) words: the sum of the absolute values of the deviations Rule 4: sum((heights-estimate)^2) words: the sum of the squared deviations Note: It is unlikely that students will think of the last two. That\u2019s okay, because we will introduce them in a future lesson, but you might want to present one (or both) to see what they think about these rules. Allow student teams time to discuss and complete the task for Plot A. Do not share their responses to Plot A. Instead, display the following questions: What if we had a different set of 10 randomly selected students and plotted their heights? Would the same team win? Allow teams to discuss the questions, then share a couple of responses to the questions in the previous step. Display Plot B, found on page 2 of the Heights of Students at a High School handout ( LMR_4.4 ), then have them find the winner using this new sample. Is it the same as they chose before? Note: We do NOT know the value of the true population mean/typical value. This is what we are really trying to predict. Teams will take turns to share their work as follows: Which team did you select as the winner using Plot A? Explain the method, or rule , your team used to declare the winner. Which team did you select as the winner using Plot B? Is the winner the same? Did you use the same rule to select a winner or did it change? If it changed, explain. During the share out, students will take notes about the other teams\u2019 rules in their DS journals. Teams may continue to share at the start of the next lesson , if they run out of time.","title":"Lesson:"},{"location":"unit4/lesson5/#class-scribes","text":"One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.","title":"Class Scribes:"},{"location":"unit4/lesson6/","text":"Lesson 6: Statistical Predictions Applying the Rule Objective: Students will apply the rule statisticians use to determine the best method for predicting heights for students at a high school. Materials: Each team\u2019s rule for determining a winner (from previous lesson) Prediction Games handout ( LMR_4.5_Prediction Games ) Vocabulary: mean squared deviation, mean absolute error Essential Concepts: Essential Concepts: If we use the squared residuals rule, then the mean of our current data is the best prediction of future values. If we use the mean absolute error rule, then the median of the current data is the best prediction of future values Lesson: Ask students to recall that in the previous lesson, each student team created a rule to determine a winner. Which team\u2019s rules worked well for determining a winner? Remind them that in their DS Journals, they took notes about each team\u2019s rule as they presented. This time, they will be switching roles \u2013 instead of creating a rule to judge the given predictions, they will be given a rule and it\u2019s their job to find the best procedure to win the contest. Inform students that the question we are trying to answer is: How can we create a general rule that will always select the BEST guess to win no matter what 10 data points we are given? Explain to students that data scientists use the \u201cmean squared deviation\u201d rule (also called the \u201cmean squared error\u201d or \u201cmean squared residual\u201d rule or \u201cresidual sums of squares\u201d rule, the latter term being the most common). A \u201c deviation \u201d is the difference between our prediction and the actual outcome (as in MAD) and is sometimes called a \u201cresidual.\u201d Note to Teacher: Basically, students are being asked to determine which of these predicted values is \"closest\" to the data. One issue that comes up is dealing with positive and negative differences. Distribute the Prediction Games handout ( LMR_4.5 ). LMR_4.5 Explain the rules of the game as follows: You are allowed to use just one value for each game, and your value should be based on the data. The mean squared deviation rule says: Your score is determined by finding the average of the squared differences between your guess and the actual values. The winner is the team with the lowest mean squared deviation. For each of the games below, try the provided statistics and determine which one works best. Game 1: Predict the heights of 10 randomly chosen people. Remember: You must choose just one statistic to use as a prediction from this list: Outcomes: here are the actual heights that were selected \u2013 66, 67, 73, 68, 68, 73, 69, 64, 66, 67. Which of these numbers did best? Compare your score using the mean squared deviations. For example, using the minimum and outcomes above, gives you a mean squared deviation of: Note to teacher: The value of the mean squared deviation will always be in square units. In order to convert back to the original units, simply take the square root of the mean squared deviation. Interpretation: When using the minimum height to make predictions about all heights, our predictions will typically be off by inches. Game 2: Predict the number of steps, as counted by a FitBit, this person will take in the future. Choose your prediction from these values: Outcomes: here are the actual daily steps that this person took \u2013 0, 27903, 6044, 0, 0, 17436, 2697, 14944, 8060, 0. Which of these numbers did best? Compare your score using the mean squared deviations. Note to teacher: For Game 2, you might consider allowing students to utilize RStudio to calculate the mean squared deviation. The example below can be used to calculate the mean squared deviation for predicting daily steps using the minimum. Before revealing the codes, elicit a class discussion about how RStudio can be used to calculate the MSD. Step 1: Create a vector of the given daily steps > steps<-c(0,27903,6044,0,0,17436,2697,14944,8060,0) Step 2: Store the squared deviations > sqr_dev<-((steps-0)^2) Step 3: Find the mean of the squared deviations > mean(sqr_dev) The code can be shortened to two steps if you apply a composition of the last two functions > mean((steps-0)^2) Game 3: Predict the number of minutes it took 10 randomly selected teenagers to run the Cherry Blossom 10 Mile Race in Washington, D.C. Outcomes: here are the actual race times of the teenagers \u2013 74, 123, 121, 103, 75, 72, 85, 71, 86, 101. Which of these numbers did best? Compare your score using the mean squared deviations. Using the mean squared deviations, which statistic is the winner and which statistics placed second and third? Discuss which statistic made the best predictions in all three games. Note to teacher: Explain that the mean worked best for all three contests. Data scientists (and mathematicians) can prove that the mean will always work best (except in a few weird cases from time to time). So if you want to predict the future, the mean is the best single guess you can make. Ask: What if another data science class has a best rule that is different from ours? Another agreed upon method that data scientists and statisticians often use is the mean absolute error . It\u2019s unlikely that students will figure this out on their own. The reasons why we do it in statistics date back to the 18th century, so it won't make a lot of sense; but it\u2019s what statisticians do. The mean absolute error is expressed as (where stands for the predicted value): Explain that each team will now use the statisticians\u2019 method for declaring a winner. Display the mean absolute error formula and discuss what each symbol means. Using our previous examples, recalculate your predictions using the MAE. Using the mean absolute error, which statistic is the winner and which statistics placed second and third? Answers: Note to teacher: Explain that in this instance, the median is the \u201cwinner.\u201d This means that the way you play the game depends on the rules of the game. If we used squared deviations, play with the mean. If we use the mean absolute error (MAE), play with the median.

Materials: Arm span vs. Height Scatterplot ( LMR_4.6_Arm Span vs Height ) Note: This handout will be referenced in subsequent lessons. Assorted color markers (dry erase or overhead)\u2014See step 3 of lesson. Overhead or LCD projector Essential Concepts: Essential Concepts: When predicting values of a variable y - and if y is associated with x - then we can get improved predictions by using our knowledge about x . We essentially \u201csubset\u201d the data for a given value of x and use the mean y for those subset values. If the resulting means follow a trend, we can model this trend to generalize to as-yet unseen values of x . Lesson: Remind students that in the previous lessons they were working with height data to predict the typical height of all the students at a large high school, implementing a method used by statisticians to help them make good predictions. In addition to the height data, it turns out that each student\u2019s arm span data was also collected and recorded. Display the Arm Span vs. Height Scatterplot ( LMR_4.6 ) on a white board or overhead projector (you will write on the board or the transparency later in the lesson\u2014see step 9). LMR_4.6 Distribute the Arm Span vs. Height handout ( LMR_4.6 ). Students will refer to this handout again later in a subsequent lesson. In teams, ask students to analyze the plot and discuss the following questions: \u2022 What kind of plot is this? Scatterplot. \u2022 How many variables are displayed in this plot? Two variables. \u2022 Which variable is shown on the x-axis? On the y-axis? Arm span is shown on the x-axis and height is shown on the y-axis. \u2022 What is this plot showing? It is showing the relationship between a person\u2019s height and the person\u2019s corresponding arm span measurement. \u2022 How can I find out the height of the person whose arm span measures 68 inches? Find 68 on the x-axis. Then find the data point located at 68. Place finger on the data point and track its location on the y-axis. The height is also 68 inches. Using Talk Moves, conduct a class discussion of the questions in step 5. Remind students that we\u2019ve learned that the mean is the best way of predicting heights. The mean heights of these people is 64 inches. Ask the students: Do you think we can do better? Is 64 a good prediction for someone whose arm span is 72\u201d? What about 60\u201d? How can you come up with a rule for determining the best predicted height if you know the person\u2019s arm span? Note to teacher: Lead students to realize that they can do this by \u201csubsetting\u201d the data for the fixed x value. For example, if arm span is 60, they should consider only the heights of people whose arm span is 60 and find the mean. In teams, ask students to approximate the mean height for people whose arm span is 60, 64, 68, and 72. Note: Because the plot does not clearly show duplicate ordered pairs, an approximation is sufficient at this point. You may have students use RStudio to calculate the mean height for the specific armspans. Refer to the OPTIONAL section at the end of the lesson. Then plot these points on the graph. We will use this later \u2013 the points should be roughly along a straight line. These arm spans have a range of height values associated with them. Students may take a mean of the heights, but answers may vary. Ask students if they see any patterns or rules they can use from this to help with predictions. Because there were multiple height values associated with each arm span length, you will likely get multiple answers from students. The goal now is to come up with a rule that suggests a plausible height value for anyone with a particular arm span. A sentence starter to guide students: If a person has a bigger arm span, then we should predict [a bigger height]. If time permits, you might push them to be more precise. Let\u2019s take someone who has a 60 inch arm span. You predicted a height of . How much should we increase our prediction for people with a 62 inch arm span? Can you do this without subsetting the data and re-calculating? Conceptually, students are wrestling with the notion of the slope of the regression line but there\u2019s no need to point this out just yet.

Lesson: Distribute What\u2019s the Trend? ( LMR_4.7 ). Students will analyze the two scatterplots on the handout. The Profits per Explosion plot shows the relationship between the number of explosions in Michael Bay\u2019s movies and the profit earned by each movie. The Scores Over Time plot shows the relationship between M. Night Shyamalan movies made since The Sixth Sense was released in 1999 and their Internet Movie Database (IMBD) scores. LMR_4.7 In teams, students will discuss and record their responses to the following questions for each plot: What kind of plot is this? Scatterplot. What do the numbers on the x-axis represent? What do the numbers on the y-axis represent? The x-axis shows number of explosions and y-axis shows profit in millions of dollars. What is this plot telling us? Answers will vary. One example could be that if there are more explosions in a movie, then the movie will earn a greater profit. What kind of plot is this? Scatterplot. What do the numbers on the x-axis represent? What do the numbers on the y-axis represent? The x-axis shows the number of years since 1999 and the y-axis shows the movie\u2019s IMDB score. What is this plot telling us? Answers will vary. One example could be that as M. Night Shyamalan has produced more movies, their IMDB ratings have gone down. Allow students time to discuss and record their answers to the questions. Display both plots, if possible (students may also refer to the plots in their own handout). Discuss the following questions with the whole class: What is happening in each plot? What seems to be the trend? Guide students to understand that the Profits per Explosion plot shows an increasing trend, while the Scores Over Time plot shows a decreasing trend. An increasing trend is called a positive association and a decreasing trend is called a negative association . What does it mean to have an increasing trend and a positive association? In Profits per Explosion, it means that as the number of explosions increase, the movie profits also increase. What does it mean to have a decreasing trend and a negative association? In Scores Over Time, it means that as the years after 1999 pass, the movie IMBD ratings decrease. Quickwrite: What if we had a plot with no association ? Ask students to sketch what they think a scatterplot that shows no association looks like. A correct sketch will show a scatterplot with data points that show no positive or negative association; no trend or pattern. There would be no association or a very weak one. The data would be scattered. Select a couple of sketches to share with the whole class. Discuss why the sketches show no association. Ask students to discuss their thoughts about why a line was drawn through the points of the two plots and why there are equations for each plot. Conduct a share out of their observations. Guide students to the understanding that the shape of both plots is linear . The line represents a model for the relationship between two variables. The equation shown in the plots above represents the line through the points. It provides a description of the data and the relationship between the variables. Distribute Strength of Association ( LMR_4.8_Strength of Association ). In teams, students will examine the scatterplots (b) through (e). Their task is to discuss the strength of the association for each plot. They will determine which plots they think show strong associations and which ones they believe show weak associations. They must explain how they made their decision. Reasons must reference the plots. As an example, demonstrate how to describe plot (a) in the Strength of Association handout. Possible description: Plot (a) shows a negative association, or decreasing trend. The association appears to be fairly strong because the points are relatively close together, forming a moderate linear pattern. LMR_4.8 Once all teams have completed the handout, assign one plot to each team for a share out. If two teams have the same plot, one team will share its explanation first and the second team can agree, disagree, or add to the first team\u2019s description. Guide students to understand that a strong association has points closer to each other and a weak association has points more scattered. If students run out of time, they will complete the remainder of the activity for homework. Class Scribes: One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.

Lesson: If necessary, begin by sharing out the descriptions for the plots in the Strength of Association ( LMR_4.8_Strength of Association ) handout from the previous lesson. Inform students that in this lesson, they will estimate the equation of the line of best fit for a height and arm span data set. Refer students back to the plots in the What\u2019s the Trend? handout ( LMR_4.7_What\u2019s the Trend ). The line in each of the plots is known as the line of best fit , or the regression line . This is a trend line that best represents or models the data in each scatterplot. Ask students: Why do you think this line is called \u201cbest fit\u201d? Some possible answers are that it is a line that is closest to all data points or that it \u201cfits\u201d evenly among the data points. This is a good time to refer back to the discussion about height versus arm span in lesson 7 . Distribute The Spaghetti Line ( LMR_4.9_The Spaghetti Line ) to each student and a couple of spaghetti strands per team. Students will estimate the line of best fit as outlined in the handout. Team solutions should be recorded on poster paper. They will glue their assigned plot on the poster and record their responses to the questions on the poster paper. Note to teacher: If necessary, review how to find the slope of a line using two points and how to write an equation using the slope and y-intercept. LMR_4.9_The Spaghetti Line Ask teams to post their work around the room. Conduct a Gallery Walk so that teams can see each other\u2019s work. Lead a discussion about the teams\u2019 lines. Ask: Which team has the best line? Why? Note to teacher: Push the students a bit by adding an obviously bad line to the graph and asking why their line is better than this one. Push them to come to an understanding that the \u201cbest\u201d line comes close to the most points. Inform students that data scientists have a way of finding the best line. They choose the line so that the mean squared distances between the points and the line is as small as possible. Discuss with students: What methods have we used so far? We\u2019ve used Mean Squared Deviations and Mean Absolute Error ( Lesson 6 ). How did we use these methods? It was best to use Mean Squared Deviations when we are looking at mean and Mean Absolute Error when we are looking at median. Which method do you think data scientists use most often? Data scientists often use MAE. [See graphic below] If time permits, ask students to calculate the distances and squares of two different lines so that they can understand what it means.

Follow the directions below to explore and analyze the data: You will have two data sets: one for training named cereal and one for testing named cereal_test . Load both data sets. Write down the code you used. Explore the training data. Make several plots of different variable combinations and fit a linear regression line through them. Select the model that you think best makes the best prediction. For the linear model your team selected: a. Describe what the plot shows. b. Explain why you selected that particular model. c. Compute the mean absolute error of your model using your testing data. d. Now make a set of predictions with your testing data. Calculate the mean absolute error for the testing data. Is it better or worse than for the training data, or about the same? Present your team\u2019s linear model to the class.

Your team will use the data to make predictions using linear models and compare the accuracy of your model to the rest of your classmates. Finally, the class will determine which team had the best prediction. Follow the directions below to explore and analyze the data: You will have two data sets: one for training named cereal and one for testing named cereal_test . Load both data sets. Write down the code you used. Explore the training data. Make several plots of different variable combinations and fit a linear regression line through them. Select the model that you think best makes the best prediction. For the linear model your team selected: a. Describe what the plot shows. b. Explain why you selected that particular model. c. Compute the mean absolute error of your model using your testing data. d. Now make a set of predictions with your testing data. Calculate the mean absolute error for the testing data. Is it better or worse than for the training data, or about the same? Present your team\u2019s linear model to the class.
