    "title": "Version 7.2 Updates: Statistical Questions and Assessments",
    "body": "Version 7.2 of the Introduction to Data Science (IDS) website introduces simplified wording for statistical questions. Specifically, survey questions are no longer classified as statistical questions, and the term 'investigative' has been removed from 'statistical investigative questions', except in lab contexts. A significant addition is the Pre- and Post-implementation Activities, which utilize the LOCUS (Levels of Conceptual Understanding in Statistics) assessment. This assessment is designed to be administered once before any IDS instruction begins (start/pre-assessment) and again after all IDS instruction for the course has concluded (end/post-assessment). Details for these activities can be found in the 'Addendum_IDS_Survey_LOCUS' file within the Documents Tool on the Portal."

  {
    "title": "Version 7.1 Updates: IDS Survey Campaign and Lab Revisions",
    "body": "Version 7.1 of the IDS website introduces a new campaign titled 'IDS Survey'. This campaign includes pre-instruction and post-instruction components, to be administered once before instruction of IDS lessons and once after instruction concludes. All labs have been updated to include numbered questions, and some blue questions have been changed to red to aid recognition by LaiLA. Consequently, all LRSs (Lesson Resource Sheets) and lab solutions have been revised to align with this new lab question numbering system. Unit 3 also saw changes: 'TB or Not TB' is now a Practicum in Section 1 (previously an End of Unit Project), the 'Music to my Ears' Practicum was removed, and 'What Does Our Campaign Data Say?' is now the End of Unit Project in Section 5 (previously a Practicum)."
  },
  {
    "title": "Version 7.0 Updates: LMR Naming, Datasets, and Unit-Specific Changes",
    "body": "Version 7.0 standardized the naming convention for LMRs (Lesson Material Resources) to match the Unit and Lesson structure (e.g., LMR_1.1_Data Diary is now LMR_U1_L1). All preloaded datasets were updated to reflect original variable names (e.g., 'gender' in the 'cdc' dataset is now 'sex'). The 'cdc', 'atus', and 'futbol' datasets have been updated with more recent data. An anonymized dataset for the 'Stress/Chill' campaign is available via `extra_data('stresschill_ids')`, with instructions provided for merging it with class data. Unit 1 saw updates to Lesson 5's 'Oscar winners' data and Lesson 14's use of the 'sex' variable. Unit 2 changed 'biased' to 'unfair' in Lesson 9 and updated 'household size' to 'household activities' (ATUS variable change) in Lesson 17. Unit 3 revised Lesson 8's spurious correlations examples and updated Lessons 21 and 22 to compare HTML and XML code, with corresponding LMR updates."
  },
  {
    "title": "Version 6.0 Updates: Enhanced Labs and Anonymized Datasets",
    "body": "Version 6.0 introduced clearer instructions for labs, including text directing students to perform tasks within the RStudio/Posit interface using midnightblue font. GPS functionality no longer reports precise locations. Anonymized datasets are now available for the 'Food Habits', 'Personality Colors', and 'Time Use' campaigns, accessible through `extra_data('food_ids')`, `extra_data('color_ids')`, and `extra_data('timeuse_ids')` respectively. Unit 1 campaign guidelines for 'Food Habits' and 'Time Use' were clarified, and LMR_1.1 was updated to reflect 'TikTok' instead of 'Facebook'. LMR_1.16 was updated with new data/color palette, and LMR_118 formatting was improved. Labs 1B, 1C, 1D, and 1F received additional clarifications and guidance, including embedded videos. Unit 2's 'Stress/Chill' campaign questions were clarified, and a picture question was removed. Unit 4 saw a significant overhaul, with Section 1 becoming 'Campaigns and Community', Section 2 improving linear regression flow, Section 3 focusing on multivariable regression, and Section 4 rearranging lessons for better conceptual building. Lesson 18 included instructions for the k-means clustering app. Unit 4 assessments and Lab 4D solutions were also updated."
