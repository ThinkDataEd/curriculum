    "title": "Abstract of Unit 1, Section 1: Data Are All Around",
    "body": "This section, 'Data Are All Around,' is the first in Unit 1 and spans 7 instructional days. It introduces students to the pervasive nature of data in everyday life and the importance of organizing it. Key concepts include understanding that data collected from surveys exhibit variability, and that tools like distributions, graphs, and plots are essential for organizing data to comprehend this variability. Statistical questions are framed around phenomena with variability, which can be simplified using basic statistics. The section emphasizes the role of computers in transforming data handling and analysis. Learning objectives cover summarizing and representing data, comparing data sets using statistics, representing relationships between quantitative variables, constructing arguments, using tools strategically, handling data in computational formats, understanding data representations, and participating in data collection campaigns. Language objectives focus on using complex sentences and mathematical vocabulary to discuss data concepts. Data collection methods include maintaining a data diary, using 'Stick Figures' data, organizing class data, and a 'Food Habits Participatory Sensing Campaign'. The section also includes a legend for activity icons."

    "title": "Enduring Understandings of Data",
    "body": "Data are fundamental to our daily existence and play a significant role in understanding real-life events and people. Organizing data provides concrete evidence. A key aspect of data collection, particularly through surveys, is the inherent variability in the responses. This variability can be effectively managed and understood using tools such as distributions, graphs, and plots. Statistical questions are designed to address phenomena (people, processes, or events) that naturally exhibit variability. While variability can be complex, basic statistical methods can help simplify and interpret these situations. This foundational understanding sets the stage for data analysis and interpretation throughout the unit."

    "title": "Learning Objectives: Statistical/Mathematical",
    "body": "This unit focuses on statistical and mathematical objectives related to data representation and interpretation. Specifically, students will learn to summarize, represent, and interpret data for a single count or measurement variable. This includes representing data using various plots such as dotplots, histograms, bar plots, and boxplots on the real number line (S-ID 1). Students will also learn to use appropriate statistics, like the median and mean, to compare the center of two or more different data sets, considering the shape of their distributions (S-ID 2). Furthermore, they will represent data involving two quantitative variables on a scatterplot and describe the relationship between these variables (S-ID 6). These objectives build a foundation for understanding data distributions and comparisons."

    "title": "Learning Objectives: Standards for Mathematical Practice",
    "body": "In Unit 1, students will focus on developing key Standards for Mathematical Practice (SMP). Specifically, SMP-3, 'Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others,' will be emphasized, encouraging students to articulate their mathematical thinking and evaluate the reasoning of their peers. Additionally, SMP-5, 'Use appropriate tools strategically,' will be a core focus, guiding students to select and effectively employ the right tools, including software and graphical representations, for data analysis. These practices are crucial for developing robust mathematical and data science skills throughout the unit."

    "title": "Learning Objectives: Data Science",
    "body": "The data science objectives for this unit aim to provide students with practical experience in handling data. Students will learn to organize data using common structures like rectangular or spreadsheet formats, recognizing these as essential data storage mechanisms. They will also understand that everyday activities can be observed and recorded as data. A key distinction to be made is between plots used for categorical versus numerical variables. Students will interpret and understand graphs representing distributions for both types of variables. This hands-on approach prepares them for more complex data analysis tasks."

    "title": "Learning Objectives: Applied Computational Thinking using RStudio",
    "body": "This unit incorporates applied computational thinking, specifically utilizing RStudio. Students will learn to work effectively in team settings to solve data-related problems. A fundamental concept they will explore is how data, information, and knowledge are represented in formats suitable for computational processing. A significant activity involves collecting, uploading, and sharing personal data through a 'Participatory Sensing' campaign. Students will also investigate different software-based representations of data distributions and use RStudio to analyze data collected during the campaign."

    "title": "Learning Objectives: Real-World Connections",
    "body": "A primary goal of this unit is to foster an awareness among students that data permeates their everyday lives. They will learn that information can be systematically collected and organized. The immense power of computers in simplifying the organization, storage, retrieval, and analysis of data for problem-solving and decision-making will be highlighted. Students will begin to recognize the direct relevance of data collection and analysis to their personal experiences. Crucially, they will understand that raw data, once interpreted, can lead to significant discoveries and deeper understandings."

    "title": "Language Objectives for Data Discussion",
    "body": "Students will enhance their communication skills regarding data through specific language objectives. Firstly, they will utilize complex sentence structures to articulate their comprehension of data, including its collection, usage, and manipulation. Secondly, students are expected to employ precise mathematical vocabulary when describing data and the various methods used for its organization. Finally, they will practice writing informative short reports that integrate data science concepts and skills, further solidifying their understanding and ability to communicate data-related findings."
