    "title": "Abstract of Unit 1, Section 2: Visualizing Data",
    "body": "Unit 1, Section 2 focuses on visualizing data over 14 instructional days. It covers enduring understandings related to data collection's impact, the power of visual representations, describing variability through distributions, and using technology for complex data analysis. The section includes an engagement activity with a video on data visualization, learning objectives in statistical, data science, computational thinking (RStudio), and real-world contexts, along with language objectives for describing data distributions and visualizations. Data sources include student-collected 'Food Habits Campaign' data and the 'cdc' dataset from RStudio. Key concepts include different types of plots (dotplots, histograms, bar plots, boxplots, scatterplots), interpreting shape, center, and spread, identifying outliers, and differentiating between quantitative and categorical variables. Computational thinking skills involve using RStudio for data handling and visualization."

  {
    "title": "Real-World Connections: Data Interpretation",
    "body": "Students will deepen their understanding that raw data, by itself, is merely collected information. The true value emerges when this data is interpreted, leading to potential discoveries, insights, and a more profound understanding of real-world phenomena. This section emphasizes the transformative power of data analysis."

  {
    "title": "Vocabulary: Data Visualization",
    "body": "Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data. It plays a crucial role in making data understandable and actionable."

  {
    "title": "Vocabulary: Distribution",
    "body": "In statistics, a distribution describes how data points are spread out. It shows the values a variable can take and the frequency of those values. Understanding the distribution helps in analyzing the central tendency, variability, and shape of the data. For numerical data, this can be visualized with histograms or dotplots; for categorical data, with bar plots."
  },
  {
    "title": "Vocabulary: Outlier",
    "body": "An outlier is a data point that differs significantly from other observations in a dataset. Outliers can occur due to variability in the measurement or experimental error. Identifying and understanding outliers is important because they can affect statistical analyses, such as the mean, and can sometimes reveal important information about the data or the process generating it."
  },
  {
    "title": "Vocabulary: Scatterplot",
    "body": "A scatterplot is a type of data visualization that uses Cartesian coordinates to display values for typically two variables for a set of data. Each variable in the data set is plotted along one of the axes. A scatterplot reveals the relationship (correlation) between two quantitative variables. It can show linear, non-linear, or no relationship."
  },
  {
    "title": "Vocabulary: Quantitative Variable",
    "body": "A quantitative variable is a variable that can take on numerical values, where the arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are meaningful. Examples include height, weight, age, temperature, or price. These variables are often visualized using histograms, boxplots, or scatterplots."
  },
  {
    "title": "Vocabulary: Categorical Variable",
    "body": "A categorical variable, also known as a qualitative variable, is a variable that can take on one of a limited, and typically fixed, number of possible values, assigning each person or a given thing to a particular group płace or category. Examples include gender, color, or type of food. Bar plots and pie charts are common visualizations for categorical data."

  {
    "title": "RStudio/Posit Cloud: Objects, Functions, and Assignments",
    "body": "Working in RStudio/Posit Cloud involves understanding core programming concepts. Objects are containers for data (like variables or data frames). Functions are pre-defined commands that perform specific actions (like plotting data). Assignments use the '<-' operator to store the result of a function or a value into an object. For example, `my_data <- read.csv('data.csv')` reads a CSV file into an object named `my_data`."
