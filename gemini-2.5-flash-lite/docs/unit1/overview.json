    "body": "Unit 1, titled 'Introduction to Data Science Daily Overview', spans 35 days and is divided into three main themes: 'Data Are All Around' (7 days), 'Visualizing Data' (14 days), and 'Would You Look at the Time?' (9 days), concluding with an 'End of Unit Project' (5 days). The unit introduces fundamental data science concepts including defining data, understanding consumer privacy, organizing and collecting data, data structures (rows, columns, variables), the data cycle, and statistical questions. It progresses to data visualization techniques such as dot plots, histograms, and exploring single and multi-variable plots. Key tools like RStudio are introduced, along with practical labs on data manipulation, import/export, and subsetting. The unit also delves into analyzing categorical data using two-way tables, exploring joint relative frequencies, and marginal/conditional relative frequencies. The 'Food Habits' and 'Time Use' datasets are used as case studies throughout the unit, culminating in a project where students evaluate claims from the media. The unit incorporates hands-on labs and practicums to reinforce learning and build practical data science skills."
