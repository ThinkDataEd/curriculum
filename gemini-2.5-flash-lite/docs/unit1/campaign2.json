    "title": "Abstract: Campaign Guidelines - Time Use",
    "body": "This campaign focuses on understanding how individuals, specifically students, spend their time, comparing it to national averages. The core issue is the increasing amount of time spent interacting with technology and the internet, prompting questions about personal time allocation, group differences in activities, and comparisons to the U.S. population. Students will collect their own time-use data for at least five days, recording minutes spent on various activities like sleeping, eating, school, homework, work, grooming, travel, chores, watching television, playing video games, sports, reading, communicating, socializing, spiritual activities, purchasing, hobbies/leisure, and social media. This data collection aims to enable comparisons with the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) dataset. The campaign objectives include students using single and multivariable plots, summary statistics, and frequency tables to identify similarities and differences in time use. It also provides technical guidance on analysis using RStudio and explores guiding questions for statistical inquiry, culminating in a practicum where students answer a statistical question based on their collected data. A key element is ensuring consensus on variable definitions to maintain data quality."

    "title": "Unit 1 Campaign 2: The Issue of Time Use",
    "body": "Unit 1 Campaign 2 addresses the growing concern regarding the significant amount of time individuals spend interacting with technology and the internet. This phenomenon raises several critical questions about personal time management and societal trends. These questions include: How do individuals personally allocate their time throughout the day? Are there observable differences in time allocation patterns among various demographic groups? How does an individual's time use compare to that of the broader American population? Understanding these aspects is crucial for gaining insights into modern lifestyle habits and the impact of digital engagement on daily routines."

    "title": "Unit 1 Campaign 2: Objectives and Learning Outcomes",
    "body": "Upon successful completion of Unit 1 Campaign 2, students will be equipped with the skills to compare their personal time usage patterns against the demographic data of the U.S. population. This comparison will help them determine similarities and differences in how their time is spent relative to the general populace. To achieve this, students will employ a variety of statistical tools, including single and multivariable plots, summary statistics, and frequency tables. These analytical methods will be used to identify and articulate patterns, similarities, and differences not only between groups of students but also between students and other residents of the United States. The campaign emphasizes a data-driven approach to understanding time allocation."

    "title": "Unit 1 Campaign 2: Survey Data Collection - Activities and Variables",
    "body": "Unit 1 Campaign 2 involves students collecting their own time-use data, mirroring categories found in the American Time Use Survey (ATUS). This allows for a comparison between personal habits and nationally representative estimates. Before data collection, it is vital to establish a class consensus on the definitions of various activities to ensure consistent and accurate data analysis. Students must avoid 'double-dipping,' meaning time spent on one activity should not be counted towards another if it overlaps (e.g., reading during class counts as 'school,' not 'read'). The survey collects data on the following activities, measured in minutes: sleep, meals, school, homework, work, grooming, travel/commuting, household chores, watching television (including streaming), playing video games, sports/exercise/physical activity, reading (not for class), communicating (texting, emails, calls), socializing (in person, outside class), spiritual activities, purchasing items, hobbies/volunteering/leisure/extra-curricular activities (excluding sports), and social media. Automatic variables include location (lat, long), time, and date."

    "title": "Unit 1 Campaign 2: Survey Data Collection - Prompts and Data Types",
    "body": "In Unit 1 Campaign 2, students collect data using specific prompts for various daily activities. The 'day' variable is an ordinal category (integers 1-10). For activities, students record the number of minutes spent. The specific prompts and corresponding variables are: 'How many MINUTES did you sleep?' (sleep), 'How many MINUTES did you spend eating/drinking?' (meals), 'How many MINUTES did you spend in classes at school?' (school), 'How many MINUTES did you spend doing homework?' (homework), 'How many MINUTES did you spend working at a job?' (work), 'How many MINUTES did you spend grooming yourself?' (grooming), 'How many MINUTES did you spend traveling/commuting?' (travel), 'How many MINUTES did you spend doing household chores?' (chores), 'How many MINUTES did you spend watching television (including streaming)?' (television), 'How many MINUTES did you spend playing video games?' (videogames), 'How many MINUTES did you spend participating in sports/exercise/physical activity?' (sports), 'How many MINUTES did you spend reading (not for class)?' (read), 'How many MINUTES did you spend communicating (includes texting, emails, video and voice calls)?' (communicate), 'How many MINUTES did you spend socializing (outside of class, in person)?' (socialize), 'How many MINUTES did you spend on a spiritual activity?' (spiritual), 'How many MINUTES did you spend purchasing items online or in a store?' (purchases), 'How many MINUTES did you spend on hobbies/volunteering/leisure/extra-curricular activities (excluding sports and physical activity)?' (extra), and 'How many MINUTES did you spend on social media?' (social_media). Data for location, time, and date are collected automatically."

    "title": "Unit 1 Campaign 2: Data Collection Schedule and Duration",
    "body": "For Unit 1 Campaign 2, students are advised to maintain a log of their time throughout the day. It is recommended to submit one survey at the end of each day, ensuring that all 1,440 minutes are accounted for. To facilitate this, students can break down their log into three intervals: before school, after school, and in the evening. This systematic approach helps in accurately capturing all activities. The campaign requires students to collect data for a minimum of five days, with a maximum limit of ten days. Ideally, this period should include at least two weekend days to capture variations in time use between weekdays and weekends. Consistent data submission after each day is encouraged to maintain data integrity."

    "title": "Unit 1 Campaign 2: Guiding Questions for Statistical Inquiry",
    "body": "Unit 1 Campaign 2 provides a set of guiding questions to direct students' statistical inquiry and analysis of their collected time-use data. These questions encourage critical thinking about the data and its implications. The primary questions are: 1) On average, how long do students estimate they spend on homework? This prompts an initial hypothesis and later comparison with collected data. 2) Are there specific activities that consume the majority of a student's day? This question focuses on identifying time-intensive activities. 3) Do specific groups of students exhibit similar patterns in how they spend their time? This question encourages the exploration of potential clustering or shared behaviors within the student cohort. These questions serve as a framework for the campaign's statistical exploration."

    "title": "Unit 1 Campaign 2: Culminating Practicum and Reporting",
    "body": "The culmination of Unit 1 Campaign 2 is a practicum where students will apply their data analysis skills to answer a specific statistical question. This question will be based on the time-use data they have collected throughout the campaign. The practicum requires students to synthesize their findings, interpret the results in the context of their data and the broader objectives of the campaign, and present their conclusions. This hands-on project allows students to demonstrate their understanding of data collection, statistical analysis techniques (including plots, summaries, and tables), and their ability to draw meaningful insights from real-world data. The report will reflect their ability to address the campaign's guiding questions and compare their findings to national trends."

    "title": "Vocabulary: American Time Use Survey (ATUS)",
    "body": "The American Time Use Survey (ATUS) is a survey conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics that collects nationally representative estimates of how Americans aged 15 and over spend their time on a given day. It provides detailed information on activities such as working, sleeping, eating, leisure, and caring for others. The data from ATUS is used to understand national patterns of time allocation, identify trends, and inform policy decisions. In Unit 1 Campaign 2, students use categories similar to ATUS to collect their own data, enabling them to compare their personal time use to official national statistics."

  {
    "title": "Vocabulary: Single and Multivariable Plots",
    "body": "In statistical analysis, plots are graphical representations of data used to visualize patterns, trends, and relationships. Single-variable plots, such as histograms and bar graphs, display the distribution of a single variable. For example, a histogram of 'sleep' minutes would show how frequently different amounts of sleep time occur. Multivariable plots, like scatterplots, are used to examine the relationship between two or more variables. A scatterplot could show the relationship between 'homework' minutes and 'sleep' minutes, helping to identify if more homework correlates with less sleep. Unit 1 Campaign 2 utilizes these plots to analyze time-use data."

    "title": "Vocabulary: Summary Statistics",
    "body": "Summary statistics are numerical values that summarize key features of a dataset. They provide a concise way to describe the central tendency and dispersion of data. Common summary statistics include: mean (the average value), median (the middle value when data is ordered), MAD (Median Absolute Deviation, a robust measure of variability), and standard deviation (a measure of the spread of data around the mean). In Unit 1 Campaign 2, students will calculate these statistics for various time-use activities to understand the typical amount of time spent and the variability within the student group and in comparison to national data."
  },
  {
    "title": "Vocabulary: Frequency Tables",
    "body": "Frequency tables, also known as contingency tables or cross-tabulations, are used in statistics to display the distribution of data for two or more variables. A one-way frequency table shows the frequency (count) of each category for a single variable. A two-way frequency table shows the joint frequencies for two variables, allowing for the examination of potential relationships between them. For instance, a two-way table could show the relationship between gender (variable 1) and hours spent on social media (variable 2). Unit 1 Campaign 2 uses frequency tables to organize and analyze the collected time-use data, identifying patterns and comparisons."

    "title": "Code Piece: Data Collection Variables (Unit 1 Campaign 2)",
    "body": "This outlines the variables collected in Unit 1 Campaign 2 for time-use data. Each variable represents a specific activity or time-related attribute. The 'day' variable is categorical (ordinal, 1-10). Most activities are measured in 'number' (minutes). Key activity variables include: 'sleep', 'meals', 'school', 'homework', 'work', 'grooming', 'travel', 'chores', 'television', 'videogames', 'sports', 'read', 'communicate', 'socialize', 'spiritual', 'purchases', 'extra' (hobbies/leisure), and 'social_media'. Additionally, automatic variables capture 'location' (lat, long), 'time', and 'date'. This structured data collection is crucial for subsequent statistical analysis and comparison with the ATUS dataset."
