    "title": "Loading and Inspecting the CDC Dataset with R Commands",
    "body": "During Unit 1 Lesson 13, students learn to load and inspect a dataset from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) using RStudio. The process begins by typing `data(cdc)` in the console to load the dataset into the R environment. Subsequently, `View(cdc)` opens the dataset for visual inspection, allowing students to see its rows and columns. To understand the variables available, students use `names(cdc)`, which lists all 32 variables. Further details about the dataset can be accessed using `help(cdc)`. To determine the size of the dataset, `dim(cdc)` is employed, revealing the number of observations (rows) and variables (columns). These commands provide a structured way to begin exploring a new dataset."
  },
  {
    "title": "Understanding Dataset Dimensions with `dim()`",
    "body": "A key skill taught in Unit 1 Lesson 13 is understanding the structure of a dataset using the `dim()` command in RStudio. After loading a dataset like `cdc`, students are instructed to type `dim(cdc)` into the console. This command outputs two numbers: the first represents the total number of rows (observations) in the dataset, and the second represents the total number of columns (variables). For the `cdc` dataset, `dim(cdc)` reveals there are 17,232 rows and 32 columns. This output is crucial for understanding the scale of the data and the number of data points and features available for analysis. Comparing this output to the preview and environment panes reinforces the understanding of the dataset's structure."

  {
    "title": "Exploring Variable Counts with `tally()`",
    "body": "Unit 1 Lesson 13 introduces the `tally()` command in RStudio for examining the distribution of observations within different categories of a variable. For example, `tally(~seat_belt, data = cdc)` shows the count of observations for each category of seat belt usage (e.g., 'Never', '<NA>'). This helps in understanding the frequency of different responses. When `tally()` is applied to a numerical variable like height (`tally(~height, data = cdc)`), the output differs because numerical variables don't have predefined levels in the same way categorical variables do. This distinction highlights the nature of categorical data, where `tally()` is most effective for summarizing counts across groups."

  {
    "title": "Categorical vs. Numerical Variables in RStudio",
    "body": "A fundamental concept covered in Unit 1 Lesson 13 is the distinction between categorical and numerical variables. Students learn that a categorical variable, like `seat_belt` in the CDC dataset, consists of distinct groups or labels (e.g., 'Never', 'Always'). A numerical variable, such as `height`, is represented by numbers and can be measured. Through exercises where students categorize variables like `eat_fruit` (categorical), `weight` (numerical), `grade` (categorical), and `drive_text` (categorical), they solidify their understanding of this important data classification. This concept is crucial for choosing appropriate analytical methods."

  {
    "title": "Distinguishing Categorical and Numerical Data",
    "body": "A core concept in Unit 1 Lesson 13 is differentiating between categorical and numerical data types, a crucial step in data analysis. Students are taught that **categorical variables** represent groups or categories, such as responses to survey questions like 'seat_belt' usage. These variables cannot be meaningfully averaged or used in standard arithmetic operations. **Numerical variables**, on the other hand, represent quantities and are expressed as numbers, such as 'height' or 'weight'. These variables can be used in mathematical calculations. The lesson includes an exercise where students classify variables from the `cdc` dataset (e.g., `eat_fruit`, `weight`, `grade`) into these two types, reinforcing this fundamental distinction."
