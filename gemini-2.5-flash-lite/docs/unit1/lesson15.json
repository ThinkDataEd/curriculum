    "title": "Abstract for Unit 1 Lesson 15: Americans' Time on Task",
    "body": "This lesson introduces the \"Time Use\" Campaign by engaging students with an interactive graphic from The New York Times that visualizes data from the American Time Use Survey. Students will explore how different demographic groups spend their time, sparking curiosity about personal time allocation. A key objective is to develop skills in evaluating data-driven claims by analyzing the Pew Research Center's article on teens and social media usage. Students will use a K-L-W graphic organizer to document their knowledge and questions about the topic. The lesson culminates with students preparing to participate in the \"Time Use Campaign\" themselves, collecting their own time-use data over several days using provided digital tools, and learning to monitor data collection progress. They will also evaluate the Pew Research article based on data collection methods and claims made."

    "title": "Vocabulary: Evaluate",
    "body": "The term 'evaluate' is a key vocabulary word in Unit 1 Lesson 15. It means to think critically about something. In the context of this lesson, students are instructed to evaluate reports and articles that make claims based on data. This involves examining the evidence, methodology, and conclusions presented to determine the validity and reliability of the information. Critical evaluation is essential for understanding how data is used to support arguments and for developing statistical literacy."
  },
  {
    "title": "Vocabulary: Claim",
    "body": "In Unit 1 Lesson 15, the term 'claim' is defined as a statement of something. When analyzing reports or articles that use data, it is important for students to identify the specific claims being made. A claim is essentially an assertion that something is true. Students will learn to distinguish between claims and the data or evidence used to support them, which is a fundamental aspect of critical thinking and data analysis."

  {
    "title": "Essential Concepts: Examining Analyses",
    "body": "A core concept in Unit 1 Lesson 15 is that learning to examine other analyses is an important part of statistical thinking. This means students are encouraged to critically review how data has been interpreted and presented by others. By dissecting reports, articles, and graphics that use statistical data, students develop a deeper understanding of the analytical process and learn to identify potential biases, limitations, or strengths in those analyses. This concept underpins the lesson's focus on evaluating data-driven claims."

    "title": "Lesson Activity: Exploring the American Time Use Graphic",
    "body": "As part of Unit 1 Lesson 15, students begin by familiarizing themselves with the \"Time-Use Campaign Guidelines.\" In pairs, they make predictions related to the campaign's overarching questions. The lesson then introduces the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) as a collector of American time-use data. Students access and explore the interactive multimedia graphic 'The New York Time's How Different Groups Spend Their Time' for 10 minutes. During this exploration, they are tasked with answering specific questions about the graphic's variables, its overall message, the data source, and interesting findings. These findings are then shared in pairs and subsequently with the whole class in a 'Whip Around' activity, encouraging collaborative learning and discussion."
