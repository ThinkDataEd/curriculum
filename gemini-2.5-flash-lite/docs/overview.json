The course aims to equip students with skills at the intersection of data analysis, computing, and mathematics through hands-on activities and real-world \"Big Data\" paradigms. It contrasts with traditional statistics by using algorithmic inference with modern randomization and simulation techniques. Developed for diverse student populations, IDS aligns with CCSS-M, SMP, CSTA, and ACT standards. The curriculum requires a 1:1 computer-to-student ratio, internet access for RStudio Cloud, and specific software including the IDS ThinkData Ed app for data collection. Prerequisites include a first-year Algebra course. IDS employs a project-based learning (PBL) approach, integrating the BSCS 5-E Instructional Model. Key instructional components include Interpreting Categorical and Quantitative Data, Making Inferences and Justifying Conclusions, Conditional Probability and the Rules of Probability, and Using Probability to Make Decisions. The course stresses computational and statistical thinking, utilizing Participatory Sensing and a Data Cycle (asking questions, collecting, analyzing, interpreting data). Student collaboration, classroom discussions, and inquiry-based assignments are central. Assignments are designed for in-class completion, with RStudio labs integrated weekly. The curriculum uses a DS journal for notes and assignments. End-of-unit projects, presentations, and practicums serve as application exercises."

    "body": "A cornerstone of the Introduction to Data Science (IDS) curriculum is Participatory Sensing, a methodology that empowers students by giving them control over data collection processes. This approach allows students to gather data relevant to their own interests and lives. The curriculum is organized around a series of \"campaigns,\" which are structured inquiries where students engage in the complete statistical process—termed the Data Cycle. This cycle involves asking questions, examining and collecting data, analyzing data, interpreting findings, and iterating the process. Initially, the focus is on descriptive analysis, progressing to the use of randomization-based algorithms and simulations for inference and critical evaluation of data collection methods. By repeatedly applying the Data Cycle in diverse contexts, including self-designed campaigns, students develop the mindset and skills of data scientists."

    "title": "Interpreting Categorical and Quantitative Data in IDS",
    "body": "This component of Introduction to Data Science (IDS) covers standard data interpretations, including summaries of shape, center, and spread, as well as graphical displays like histograms and scatterplots. It acknowledges that data interpretation is rarely \"standard\" and involves constructing multiple \"views\" to uncover patterns. Beyond numerical data, IDS considers time, location, text, and image as data types. Simulation is used to calibrate interpretation and understand what \"story-less\" data (pure noise) looks like. Students also engage in modeling practices aligned with CCSS mathematical practices, learning to fit and evaluate statistical models like the least-squares regression line. Probabilistic simulations are designed and implemented to test hypotheses against real-world data."

    "title": "Making Inferences and Justifying Conclusions in IDS",
    "body": "In Introduction to Data Science (IDS), reasoning with data begins with understanding data sources and their flow, particularly in the context of Web 2.0 interoperability. Students learn to critically evaluate data sources, compare data from different organizations, and analyze previously told stories with data. They develop skills to formulate questions, identify datasets, and critique published data stories and visualizations. The curriculum integrates computational thinking with critical analysis by providing questions to ask of any data source. Simulation techniques are employed to assess uncertainty, especially for data generated through random processes like polls (random sampling) and clinical trials (random assignment). Participatory Sensing is introduced as a data collection technique, formalizing inquiries into \"campaigns\" that can augment or challenge existing data sources. Computational tools are essential for accessing data, creating views, fitting models, and assessing their significance via simulation."

    "title": "Probability and Simulation in Introduction to Data Science",
    "body": "Introduction to Data Science (IDS) uses simulation as a primary tool for data reasoning, making an understanding of basic probability rules essential. The course explores how computers generate random phenomena and uses simple probability calculations to predict simulation outcomes, formally linking simulation to theory. It motivates the relationship between frequency and probability by having students conduct and summarize simulations of independent trials. They learn that as the number of simulations increases, the observed frequency of an event converges to its theoretical probability (Law of Large Numbers). Probability serves as a measure for assessing the significance of findings derived from data, especially when random mechanisms are part of the data design. Both direct mathematical calculations and computer simulations are used to build a deep understanding of statistical concepts."
