    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14: Abstract",
    "body": "This lesson, \"The Titanic Shuffle,\" aims to teach students that differences observed between two groups can occur by chance and are usually small. The lesson uses the historical context of the Titanic disaster to explore whether the fare price of a passenger's ticket influenced their survival. Students will engage in a hands-on activity involving shuffled data strips representing Titanic passengers. They will calculate median fare prices for 'survivor' and 'victim' groups, analyze the difference, and then repeat a shuffling process to simulate random chance. By comparing the actual difference to the differences generated by shuffling, students will learn to distinguish between chance variation and potentially 'real' differences. The lesson introduces the concept of using the difference in medians as a statistic and visually represents the distribution of these differences to identify unusual outcomes. This activity prepares students for a more in-depth analysis using RStudio in a subsequent lab."

    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14: Objective",
    "body": "The primary objective of Unit 2 Lesson 14, \"The Titanic Shuffle,\" is for students to understand that observed differences between two groups can arise purely by chance. Furthermore, students should grasp that differences attributable to chance are typically small. This lesson builds upon previous concepts by applying them to a numerical variable (fare price) within the context of the Titanic disaster."
  },
  {
    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14: Materials",
    "body": "The required materials for Unit 2 Lesson 14, \"The Titanic Shuffle,\" include: LMR_Titanic_Strips (which need to be cut into individual strips beforehand, one per student, representing passenger data including fare and survival status), poster paper (with the x-axis potentially pre-drawn from -£30 to £30), and markers for creating dotplots and recording data."
  },
  {
    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14: Essential Concepts",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 14 introduces the concept of shuffling data based on numerical variables, using the difference in medians as the statistic. The distribution generated through this shuffling process represents outcomes expected if chance were the sole factor. Small observed differences suggest they might be due to chance, while significantly larger differences raise suspicion of a 'real' underlying effect. This helps students differentiate between random variation and meaningful patterns in data."
  },
  {
    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14: Recap of Previous Lesson",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 14 begins by reminding students of their previous learning in Unit 2 Lesson 13. They recall how shuffling data based on categorical variables (like gender and survival in horror movies) demonstrated that observed differences in proportions, by chance alone, were typically close to zero and usually small. This reinforces the idea that small differences are common due to chance, while larger differences are rare and potentially significant."
  },
  {
    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14: Introducing Numerical Variables",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 14 transitions from categorical variables to numerical variables. Students are informed that they will now learn how to determine if a difference between groups is significant when the variable involved is numerical. This lesson uses the context of the Titanic passengers and their fare prices to explore this concept."
  },
  {
    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14: Titanic Background",
    "body": "To set the context for Unit 2 Lesson 14, students are introduced to the historical significance of the Titanic. It was the largest cruise ship of its time, famously declared unsinkable, yet it sank on its maiden voyage, resulting in a major maritime disaster. Approximately 40% of passengers survived, but survival chances were heavily influenced by factors like age, gender, and wealth. This historical backdrop is crucial for understanding the data analysis that follows."
  },
  {
    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14: Activity Setup - Titanic Strips",
    "body": "In Unit 2 Lesson 14, students will engage with data from 40 actual Titanic passengers using the LMR_Titanic_Strips. The LMR contains data on the fare paid for a cabin and the survival status of each passenger. The advance preparation requires cutting this LMR into individual strips, ensuring each strip contains both the fare price and the corresponding survival information. This data is then used for the hands-on activity."
  },
  {
    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14: Grouping Titanic Passengers",
    "body": "For Unit 2 Lesson 14's activity, students are divided into two groups based on the number of strips available (up to 40). One group is designated as 'survivors' and receives strips with corresponding fares. The other group, 'victims,' receives the remaining strips. The aim is to have roughly 40% of the total students in the survivor group, mirroring the historical survival rate. If the class is very small (under 10), equal-sized groups are formed. Leftover strips are set aside."
  },
  {
    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14: Survivor Group Assignment",
    "body": "In Unit 2 Lesson 14, students assigned to the 'survivor' group receive a Titanic passenger strip. This strip details the fare they paid for their ticket. They are informed that a fare of £20 in 1912 is equivalent to approximately £2952 today, providing a modern context for the historical costs."
  },
  {
    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14: Victim Group Assignment",
    "body": "Students assigned to the 'victim' group in Unit 2 Lesson 14 receive a Titanic passenger strip that includes the fare they paid for their ticket. Similar to the survivor group, this fare represents the cost of their passage. Leftover strips from both groups are set aside after distribution."
  },
  {
    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14: Initial Data Visualization and Median Calculation",
    "body": "Following the group assignments in Unit 2 Lesson 14, each group (survivors and victims) creates a dotplot of their respective fare prices on poster paper. After a brief visual comparison of the two dotplots, each group calculates the median fare price for its members. This provides initial numerical data for comparison between the two groups."
  },
  {
    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14: Calculating the Observed Difference in Medians",
    "body": "In Unit 2 Lesson 14, after calculating the median fare for both the 'survivor' and 'victim' groups, the class collectively determines the difference between these medians. The calculation is performed as: median of 'Survivor' fares – median of 'Victim' fares. An example is provided: if the median survivor fare is £26.00 and the median victim fare is £13.00, the difference is £13.00. This represents the observed difference in fare prices between the two groups based on the sample data."
  },
  {
    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14: Discussing Titanic Controversies and Data Representation",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 14 addresses a key controversy surrounding the Titanic disaster: the perception that wealthier passengers had preferential access to lifeboats. The lesson clarifies that the data used (40 passenger strips) is a representative subset of the larger dataset of over 800 passengers, randomly selected to be indicative of the overall passenger population."
  },
  {
    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14: Pair Discussion - Fare and Survival Link",
    "body": "In pairs, students in Unit 2 Lesson 14 discuss whether the data suggests a link between a passenger's wealth (indicated by fare price) and their survival. They are prompted to consider if passengers who paid more for their tickets had a better chance of survival. The provided example answer indicates that yes, there is evidence, with a median difference of £13.00, and the survivor fares tend to be higher, suggesting a right-skewed distribution for survivors."
  },
  {
    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14: Shuffling the Data - Rationale",
    "body": "To test the significance of the observed difference in fare prices, students in Unit 2 Lesson 14 perform a data shuffle. They separate the fare price from the survival outcome (survivor/victim) on their strips. The survival outcomes are then collected, randomly shuffled, and redistributed. Students keep their original fare strips. This process simulates a scenario where survival is randomly assigned, independent of the fare paid."
  },
  {
    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14: Why Shuffle Outcomes, Not Fares?",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 14 prompts students to explain why the outcome (survival status) is shuffled, not the fare price. The rationale is that the investigation aims to determine if fare price affects survival. By shuffling the outcomes, we assume, for the sake of the simulation, that fare price is irrelevant to survival. Therefore, the fare prices should remain fixed to their passengers, while the survival labels are randomly reassigned to test the hypothesis."
  },
  {
    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14: Prediction for Shuffled Median Difference",
    "body": "Before calculating the median fare difference after shuffling in Unit 2 Lesson 14, students are asked to predict what this difference will be. The expected answer is that the median fare difference for the shuffled groups should be close to 0. This is because, if survival is random and unrelated to fare, the median fares for the newly formed 'survivor' and 'victim' groups should be roughly equal, leading to a minimal difference."
  },
  {
    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14: Median Calculation After Shuffling",
    "body": "After shuffling the survival outcomes in Unit 2 Lesson 14, students form new 'survivor' and 'victim' groups based on their randomly assigned outcomes. Each new group calculates its median fare price. Subsequently, the class determines the difference between these newly calculated median fares. This difference represents the outcome under the assumption of random chance."
  },
  {
    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14: Interpreting Shuffled Differences",
    "body": "Students in Unit 2 Lesson 14 are asked to evaluate the difference in medians calculated from their shuffled groups. They compare this shuffled difference to the 'real' difference observed before shuffling (e.g., £13.00). Since the shuffling assumes chance is the only factor, any difference obtained should be attributed to chance. If the shuffled difference is small, it supports the idea that the original difference might also be due to chance."
  },
  {
    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14: Tabulating Shuffled Median Differences",
    "body": "In Unit 2 Lesson 14, a table is created on the board to display the results of the median fare calculations. This table includes columns for the median fare price of survivors, the median fare price of victims, and the difference between them (Survivors - Victims). The first row is filled with the pre-shuffle observed data, and subsequent rows are populated with the results from each shuffled trial conducted by the class."
  },
  {
    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14: Dotplot of Median Differences",
    "body": "A key visual aid in Unit 2 Lesson 14 is a dotplot created on the board, labeled 'Difference in Medians.' This plot is used to visualize the distribution of the differences in median fare prices obtained from the shuffled data. A vertical line is marked on the plot at the value of the originally observed difference (e.g., £13.00) to serve as a reference point for comparison."
  },
  {
    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14: Comparing Shuffled to Actual Differences",
    "body": "After plotting the median differences from the shuffled data in Unit 2 Lesson 14, students are asked to compare these values to the actual, pre-shuffle difference (e.g., £13.00). The discussion typically reveals that the shuffled differences are much smaller and centered around 0, highlighting that the observed difference in the original data might be statistically significant rather than just a result of random variation."
  },
  {
    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14: Chance vs. Real Difference",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 14 reinforces the core concept: small differences in shuffled data are likely due to chance, while large differences suggest a 'real' effect. In the Titanic context, a small difference in median fares after shuffling would imply survival was largely a matter of luck. A large difference, especially if it's close to the original observed difference, would support the claim that factors like wealth (fare price) significantly impacted survival chances."
  },
  {
    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14: Repeating the Shuffle",
    "body": "To build a more robust understanding of the distribution of differences under chance, students in Unit 2 Lesson 14 repeat the shuffling process (steps 17-23) multiple times. This allows for the collection of more data points for the 'Difference in Medians' dotplot, creating a clearer picture of what outcomes are likely when survival is random."
  },
  {
    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14: Defining 'Large' and 'Small' Differences",
    "body": "In Unit 2 Lesson 14, students are guided to determine whether the originally observed difference in median fare prices (e.g., £13.00) is 'large' or 'small.' A method for defining these cut-offs is introduced: considering differences that are more than 2 Median Absolute Deviations (MAD) away from the center of the distribution as unusual or 'large.' Values falling outside these cut-offs might indicate that ticket price influenced survival."
  },
  {
    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14: Preparing for RStudio Analysis",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 14 concludes by informing students that in the next class, they will use RStudio to perform a similar shuffle analysis but with the complete dataset of all 800 Titanic passengers. This upcoming analysis will allow them to draw more definitive conclusions about whether passenger ticket price had a real impact on survival or if the observed differences were merely due to chance."
  },
  {
    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14: Class Scribes Activity",
    "body": "As a concluding activity for Unit 2 Lesson 14, a team of students is assigned the role of 'Class Scribes.' Their task is to prepare and deliver a brief presentation summarizing what they believe were the three most important topics or concepts covered during the lesson."
  },
  {
    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14: Homework and Next Steps",
    "body": "The homework and preparation for the next steps following Unit 2 Lesson 14 involve collecting data for the 'Stress/Chill' campaign over the next three days, either via the IDS Think Data Ed App or the web browser portal. Additionally, students are instructed to complete Lab 2F: The Titanic Shuffle prior to attending Lesson 15."
  },
  {
    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14: Lab 2F - The Titanic Shuffle",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 14 explicitly directs students to complete 'Lab 2F: The Titanic Shuffle' before proceeding to 'Lesson 15.' This lab likely provides a more in-depth, hands-on application of the concepts taught in Lesson 14, possibly involving simulations or further data analysis related to the Titanic passenger data."
  },
  {
    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14 Vocabulary: Difference in Medians",
    "body": "In Unit 2 Lesson 14, the 'difference in medians' is used as a key statistic when analyzing numerical variables. It is calculated by finding the median value of a numerical variable (like fare price) for one group and subtracting the median value of the same variable for a second group. This statistic helps quantify the central tendency difference between the two groups and is central to the shuffling activity used to assess the role of chance."
  },
  {
    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14 Vocabulary: Shuffling Data (Numerical)",
    "body": "Shuffling data based on numerical variables, as introduced in Unit 2 Lesson 14, involves randomly reassigning the numerical data points (or associated outcomes) to different groups. In this lesson, passenger survival outcomes are shuffled while their fare prices remain fixed. This process is performed under the null hypothesis that the numerical variable (fare price) has no effect on the outcome (survival), allowing for the generation of a distribution of results expected by chance alone."
  },
  {
    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14 Vocabulary: 'Real' Difference vs. Chance Difference",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 14 teaches students to distinguish between a 'real' difference and a 'chance' difference in data. A 'chance' difference is one that occurs randomly and is typically small, observed when data is shuffled. A 'real' difference is a statistically significant difference that is unlikely to have occurred by chance alone. By comparing the observed difference in their data to the distribution of differences from shuffled data, students can infer whether the observed difference is likely 'real' or just due to chance."
  },
  {
    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14: Numerical Variable - Fare Price",
    "body": "In Unit 2 Lesson 14, the 'fare price' is used as the primary numerical variable for analysis. Students explore whether the amount of money passengers paid for their Titanic tickets correlates with their survival status. This numerical data is used to calculate medians and differences, forming the basis for the shuffling simulation to determine the significance of observed trends."
