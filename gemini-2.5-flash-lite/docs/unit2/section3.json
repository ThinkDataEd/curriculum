    "title": "Abstract for Unit 2, Section 3",
    "body": "Unit 2, Section 3, spanning 8 instructional days, explores the concept of chance in data analysis. It introduces the idea that permutations of data can model real-world behavior driven by chance. If observed data significantly deviates from these chance permutations, it suggests that factors beyond chance are at play, indicating a potential dependent relationship between variables. The section uses a Huffington Post article, 'Don’t Take My Stress Away,' to engage students with the 'Stress/Chill Campaign.' Learning objectives cover statistical decision-making using simulations (S-IC 2, S-IC 6), understanding chance models in data science, and practical RStudio skills like data merging and permutation creation. Real-world connections highlight how understanding chance is crucial for interpreting media reports on scientific findings. Language objectives focus on discussing probabilities, writing informative reports using data science concepts, and utilizing graphical and numerical summaries. Data sources include student surveys (Personality Color, Stress/Chill campaign), and public datasets like Titanic and Horror Movie. The Stress/Chill campaign involves students self-monitoring their stress or chill states and associated factors."

    "title": "Enduring Understandings: Chance as an Explanatory Model",
    "body": "Permutations of data serve as a statistical model to understand how the world might behave if chance were the sole reason for observed differences between groups or associations between variables. If an actual observation is found to be a rare outcome within these permutations, it suggests that chance alone is not a sufficient explanation for the observed difference or association. Conversely, if the actual observation is a common outcome in the permuted data, it indicates that chance might be a valid explanation. When differences between the actual data and the permuted data are significant, it provides evidence to reject the chance model, implying a dependent relationship exists between the variables under consideration."
