    "title": "Abstract of Unit 2, Section 1",
    "body": "Unit 2, Section 1, titled 'What is Your True Color?', spans 7 instructional days and focuses on understanding how statistical measures can interpret large datasets. It introduces the concepts of measures of center (central tendency) and measures of spread (variability) to describe quantitative data. Students engage with the 'True Colors Personality Test', collecting data through a survey via the IDS ThinkData Ed App or a web portal. The learning objectives cover interpreting the structure of expressions, using statistics to compare distributions (center and spread), interpreting shape/center/spread differences considering outliers, and evaluating data-based reports. Mathematical Practice Standards emphasize modeling with mathematics and using tools strategically. Data Science objectives include understanding numerical summaries and boxplots. Applied Computational Thinking using RStudio involves calculating numerical summaries (mean, median, MAD, IQR) and creating boxplots for comparison. Real-world connections highlight the importance of synthesizing data and critically consuming statistical information in media. Language objectives focus on choosing appropriate measures of center and spread, debating distribution comparisons, and presenting statistical investigation understanding."

    "title": "Enduring Understandings: Statistics and Data Summaries",
    "body": "Statistics are essential for making sense of large volumes of data. Numerical summaries are key to capturing the important characteristics of a data distribution. Measures of center, also called measures of central tendency, indicate where the quantitative data tends to group. Measures of spread, also known as measures of variability, quantify how spread out the quantitative data is. By examining both the central clustering and the variability within data, we can gain significant insights into the dataset's nature."

    "title": "Learning Objectives: Statistical and Mathematical",
    "body": "The statistical and mathematical learning objectives for Unit 2, Section 1 include interpreting the structure of algebraic expressions (A-SSE A). Students will learn to use appropriate statistics to compare the center (median, mean) and spread (interquartile range, standard deviation) of two or more different data sets (S-ID 2). They will also interpret differences in shape, center, and spread within the context of the data, considering potential impacts of extreme values or outliers (S-ID 3). Furthermore, students will develop the ability to evaluate the reliability of reports that are based on data (S-IC 6)."

    "title": "Learning Objectives: Applied Computational Thinking and Real-World Connections",
    "body": "Using RStudio, students will gain practical skills in calculating essential numerical summaries such as the mean, median, Mean of Absolute Deviations (MAD), and Interquartile Range (IQR). They will also learn to create graphical representations, including boxplots, to effectively compare two or more datasets. The real-world relevance of this unit lies in the necessity of synthesizing vast amounts of data into understandable measures. Understanding statistical references in media is crucial for critical consumerism, requiring comprehension of data summaries."

    "title": "Language Objectives: Discussing Statistical Measures",
    "body": "Students will enhance their language skills by considering the appropriateness of using the mean versus the median as a measure of center for various data distributions. They will also determine and articulate the most suitable measure of spread for a given dataset. Furthermore, students will participate in an 'Active Debate' to discuss and compare the shape, center, and spread of different distributions, and engage in partner and whole-group activities to present their understanding of statistical investigations."

    "title": "Enduring Understandings: Measures of Center and Spread",
    "body": "The core idea is that statistical measures allow us to interpret large datasets. Specifically, numerical summaries help us understand key aspects of data distributions. Measures of center, like the mean and median, show the typical value in a dataset. Measures of spread, such as the interquartile range and standard deviation, indicate how varied the data points are. Understanding both where data clusters (center) and how much it varies (spread) provides valuable insights."

    "title": "Engagement: Personality Test Data for Analysis",
    "body": "Students will begin Unit 2, Section 1 by taking the 'True Colors Personality Test'. This activity serves as the foundation for collecting real-world data related to personality styles. The data gathered from this test will be used in subsequent lessons to explore concepts like data subsetting and the calculation of measures of central tendency and variability. The data can be accessed online or through a dedicated application."

    "title": "Learning Objectives: Statistical Comparison of Data Sets",
    "body": "A key mathematical objective is S-ID 2, which involves using statistics effectively to compare the center (mean, median) and spread (interquartile range, standard deviation) of multiple datasets. This objective is supported by A-SSE A, focusing on interpreting the structure of expressions. Students will also learn to interpret differences in data distributions' shape, center, and spread, considering the influence of outliers (S-ID 3), and to critically evaluate data-based reports (S-IC 6)."

    "title": "Vocabulary: Measures of Center",
    "body": "Measures of center, also referred to as measures of central tendency, are statistical values that describe the typical or central location of a dataset. Common measures include the mean (the average value) and the median (the middle value when data is ordered). Understanding these measures helps in summarizing the central tendency of quantitative data."

  {
    "title": "Vocabulary: Measures of Spread",
    "body": "Measures of spread, also known as measures of variability, are statistical values that describe the amount of dispersion or variability in a dataset. They indicate how spread out the data points are from the center. Key measures include the interquartile range (IQR), which measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data, and the standard deviation, which measures the average distance of data points from the mean."
