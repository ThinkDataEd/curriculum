    "title": "Unit 2 Campaign 1: Survey Data Collection Methodology",
    "body": "This campaign involves collecting data through surveys administered at randomly selected times over approximately two weeks, including at least one weekend day. Random times are generated for each of the six days to ensure varied sampling. If a selected time falls within school hours, teachers have discretion on whether to proceed. The survey collects categorical and text data on location (school, work, home, etc.), the reason for being there (in one word), the number of people present, the type of company (alone, friends/family, colleagues, etc.), and self-reported stress levels on a scale of 0 (not stressed) to 3 (very stressed). Automatic data collection includes location (latitude, longitude), time, and date."

    "title": "Unit 2 Campaign 1: Survey Question Variables",
    "body": "The survey for Unit 2 Campaign 1 collects data on several variables. 'where' is a categorical variable indicating the respondent's location (e.g., school, work, home, public place, others' house, commuting). 'why' is a text variable capturing the primary reason for being in that location in one word. 'howmanypeople' is an integer variable recording the number of people present, excluding the respondent. 'who' is a categorical variable describing the company (alone, friends and/or family, teachers and classmates, strangers, coworkers). 'stress' is an integer variable from 0 (not stressed at all) to 3 (very stressed) measuring the current stress level. Additionally, automatic variables include 'location' (lat, long), 'time', and 'date'."
