    "title": "Abstract of Unit 2, Section 2: How Likely Is It?",
    "body": "This section, titled 'How Likely Is It?', is part of Unit 2 and spans 7 instructional days. It focuses on the concept of probability, explaining that it quantifies the long-run frequency of chance outcomes. Students will learn to approximate probabilities through both simulations and mathematical calculations. The engagement activity involves analyzing a scene from 'Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead' to discuss coin toss probabilities. Learning objectives cover statistical understanding of independence (S-CP 2), using permutations for inference (S-CP 9), evaluating data-based reports (S-IC 6), designing simulations using RStudio, comparing simulated and actual data, re-randomizing data, and estimating theoretical probabilities from samples. Language objectives include constructing summary statements about probability, using Venn diagrams for compound events, and presenting understanding of simulations. Data will be collected through simulated data in RStudio."

    "title": "Enduring Understandings: Probability and Simulations",
    "body": "The core idea is that probability is a measure of how often an event is likely to occur over the long run. This can be determined in two primary ways: by conducting simulations, which mimic the real-world event, or by using mathematical calculations. Both methods help in understanding and quantifying the likelihood of different outcomes."

    "title": "Engagement Activity: Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead Coin Toss Scene",
    "body": "The engagement for this unit involves students watching a specific scene from the movie 'Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead'. This scene prompts a discussion about the probability of a coin landing on 'heads' 78 times consecutively. The scene is accessible via a provided YouTube link and embedded video."

    "title": "Learning Objective: Statistical Independence of Events (S-CP 2)",
    "body": "A key statistical objective is to understand and determine if two events, A and B, are independent. Independence is formally defined as the probability of both events occurring together being equal to the product of their individual probabilities (P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)). This understanding will be used to assess the independence of events."
