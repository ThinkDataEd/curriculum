    "title": "Abstract of Practicum 3: What Stresses Us?",
    "body": "This practicum, \"What Stresses Us?\", aims to enable students to utilize RStudio for the graphical representation and numerical summarization of their \"Stress/Chill\" and \"Personality Color\" data. The primary objective is to answer specific research questions by analyzing this combined dataset. Students are required to produce a one-page report that addresses these questions, employing the Data Cycle methodology. The analysis must incorporate both numerical summaries (e.g., means, medians) and graphical methods (plots). The report should detail the chosen plots and summaries, explain their relevance to answering the research questions, and include these visualizations and statistics. Finally, students will present their findings to a classmate, ensuring all conclusions are supported by the included data representations. This practicum builds upon skills potentially introduced in Unit 1, with guidance available in the Unit 1 scoring guide."
