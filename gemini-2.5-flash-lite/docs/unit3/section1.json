    "title": "Abstract of Unit 3, Section 1",
    "body": "This section, 'Testing, Testing… 1, 2, 3…', spans 7 instructional days and focuses on understanding experiments as a method for data collection. It emphasizes that experiments measure the effects of different treatments on an outcome of interest by applying a treatment to subjects and observing the results. Randomization is highlighted as a key technique to isolate treatment effects from unexplained variation. The section aims to teach students how data provides a basis for evidence, contrasting it with anecdotal information, and covers statistical objectives related to comparing treatments, making inferences, understanding study types, evaluating data reports, and using simulations. Data science and computational thinking objectives include testing differences between experimental groups, creating graphical representations, and writing code for random assignment. Real-world connections are made to medicine, electronics, materials science, and human behavior. Language objectives focus on comparing anecdotes and data, constructing summary statements about data handling, evaluating claims, and describing causal relationships. Students will use their own 'Time Perception' experiment data, collected through a simple experiment they conduct."

    "title": "Enduring Understandings - Experiments and Treatments",
    "body": "An experiment is a structured method for collecting data. Its primary purpose is to measure the impact of different treatments on a specific outcome. In an experiment, researchers apply a particular treatment to a group of subjects. Subsequently, they make observations to assess the effects of that treatment. To ensure that the observed effects are truly due to the treatment and not to random chance or other uncontrolled factors, randomization is employed. This means subjects are assigned to different treatment groups by chance. This process helps isolate the effects of the treatment from unexplained variations in the data."

    "title": "Enduring Understandings - Randomization in Experiments",
    "body": "Experiments are designed to measure the impact of specific interventions, known as treatments, on outcomes of interest. A core principle in designing effective experiments is the use of randomization. By assigning subjects to different treatment groups randomly, researchers can minimize the influence of confounding variables and isolate the true effect of the treatment. This chance assignment is crucial for distinguishing the effects of the treatment from inherent variability within the subject population. Randomization is a fundamental technique for establishing causality and ensuring the validity of experimental results."

    "title": "Engagement - How Not to Be Ignorant About the World Video",
    "body": "To kick off this section, students will engage with Hans Rosling’s video, 'How Not to Be Ignorant About the World.' Following the video, they will participate in an interactive quiz designed by Rosling. This activity serves to illustrate how personal experiences and anecdotes can shape our understanding of the world, often leading to ignorance. In contrast, the video and quiz will demonstrate the power of data as a foundation for evidence-based knowledge. The video is accessible online at: https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_and_ola_rosling_how_not_to_be_ignorant_about_the_world"

    "title": "Learning Objective - Statistical/Mathematical: S-IC B-5",
    "body": "A key statistical objective for this unit is S-IC B-5, which focuses on using data derived from randomized experiments. Specifically, students will learn to compare the effects of two different treatments based on this data. Furthermore, the objective includes utilizing simulations as a tool to determine whether observed differences between parameters are statistically significant, meaning they are unlikely to have occurred by random chance alone."

  {
    "title": "Learning Objective - Statistical/Mathematical: S-IC 1",
    "body": "In line with standard S-IC 1, students will develop an understanding of statistics as a systematic process. This process is centered around making inferences, or educated guesses, about broader population parameters. These inferences are based on data collected from a random sample drawn from that specific population. The core idea is to generalize findings from a smaller group to a larger one using statistical methods."

    "title": "Learning Objective - Statistical/Mathematical: S-IC 3",
    "body": "Standard S-IC 3 addresses the critical distinction between different methods of data collection and study design. Students will learn to recognize the specific purposes of sample surveys, experiments, and observational studies. Crucially, they will understand the differences between these approaches and explain how the principle of randomization plays a role in each, particularly in how it relates to the validity and interpretation of their findings."

    "body": "This learning objective, S-IC B.5, is a crucial component of the unit. It requires students to effectively use data obtained from randomized experiments to compare the outcomes of two distinct treatments. Additionally, students will gain proficiency in employing simulations. These simulations will be used to rigorously assess whether any observed differences between the parameters of interest are statistically significant, indicating a genuine effect of the treatment rather than random variation."
