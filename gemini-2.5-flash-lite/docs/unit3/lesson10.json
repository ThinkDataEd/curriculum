    "title": "Lesson 10: We're So Random - Abstract",
    "body": "This lesson focuses on collecting random samples from a population to estimate a parameter. It introduces key vocabulary such as population, sample, representative sample, random sample, parameter, and statistic. The lesson uses a Pew Research Center report on teens and friendships as a case study to discuss the concepts of sampling and its implications. Students will engage in activities to understand the difference between populations and samples, the importance of representative samples, and how random sampling can be used to estimate population characteristics. The use of RStudio for generating random samples is demonstrated, and the distinction between population parameters and sample statistics is clarified. The lesson aims to equip students with the understanding that random samples, while not perfectly representing the population, provide valuable estimates for population parameters."

    "title": "Unit 3 Lesson 10: Introduction to Random Sampling",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 10, \"We're So Random,\" aims to teach students how to collect random samples from a population to estimate a parameter. The lesson begins by discussing a Pew Research Center report stating that 57% of teens have met friends online, with a margin of error. This prompts a discussion about the sample size (1,060 teens) and how it relates to the entire population of US teens. Students explore the concept that samples may not perfectly represent the population and consider how their own class's percentage might differ. The lesson defines 'population' as everyone we want to learn about and 'sample' as a subset selected from the population. Students are asked to identify the population and sample in the Pew Research Center report. The importance of a sample being 'representative' of the population is emphasized."

    "title": "Vocabulary: Population and Sample",
    "body": "In Unit 3 Lesson 10, key terms related to data collection are introduced. A 'population' consists of all the individuals or objects that we are interested in learning about. A 'sample' is a subset of individuals or objects that are selected from the population. For example, in the Pew Research Center report discussed, the 'population' of interest was all teenagers in the US, and the 'sample' consisted of 1,060 teenagers who were interviewed. The lesson stresses that samples should ideally be 'representative,' meaning they accurately reflect the characteristics of the larger population. The activity involves students identifying populations and samples in various scenarios provided in the 'Populations & Samples' handout."

    "title": "Vocabulary: Representative and Random Sample",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 10 introduces the concepts of 'representative' and 'random sample.' A 'representative' sample is a subset of a population that accurately reflects the characteristics of the larger group. This is crucial for drawing valid conclusions about the population. A 'random sample' is a specific method of selecting a sample where each member of the population has an equal chance of being chosen. The lesson contrasts different sampling methods, such as selecting students closest to the teacher or allowing volunteers, with a truly random method like drawing names from a hat or using RStudio's `sample()` function. This ensures that the sample is less likely to be biased and more likely to be representative of the population."

    "title": "Vocabulary: Parameter and Statistic",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 10 defines 'parameter' and 'statistic' as numerical summaries of data. A 'parameter' is a number that summarizes a characteristic of an entire population. For instance, the true percentage of all US teenagers who have met friends online is a parameter. A 'statistic' is a number that summarizes a characteristic of a sample. When the Pew Research Center reported that 57% of their interviewed teens met friends online, this 57% is a statistic because it is based on a sample of 1,060 teens, not the entire population. The lesson emphasizes that while we often don't know the population parameter, we can estimate it using statistics derived from random samples. The homework assignment includes the 'Parameters & Statistics' handout to reinforce these concepts."

    "title": "Unit 3 Lesson 10: Practical Application with RStudio",
    "body": "In Unit 3 Lesson 10, students engage in a practical exercise using RStudio to generate random samples. After assigning each student in the class a number, the `sample(1:N, size = 10, replace = FALSE)` function is demonstrated. Here, 'N' represents the total number of students in the class, 'size = 10' indicates the desired sample size, and 'replace = FALSE' ensures that each student is selected only once. Students whose numbers are generated by RStudio form the sample. The percentage of this sample that has met friends online is then calculated and compared to the overall class percentage. This process is repeated multiple times, with students predicting the next sample's percentage before it is generated, to illustrate the variability of sample statistics."

    "title": "Unit 3 Lesson 10: Analyzing Sample Variability",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 10 culminates in an analysis of the variability observed in sample percentages. After collecting several random samples of 10 students and calculating the percentage who have met friends online for each, a dotplot is created to visualize these sample statistics. Students are prompted to discuss what they notice about the distribution of these percentages, identify the 'typical' value (which should be close to the population parameter), and determine the range of values (smallest and biggest). A key discussion point is how sample size affects variability: larger samples (e.g., size 15 or 20) tend to have less variability and are closer to the population parameter than smaller samples. This reinforces the idea that larger, random samples provide more reliable estimates."

    "title": "Unit 3 Lesson 10: Estimating Population Parameters",
    "body": "The core objective of Unit 3 Lesson 10 is to understand how random sampling can be used to estimate population parameters. The lesson uses a class-based example where the class itself is the population. Students collect multiple random samples and calculate sample statistics (percentages). By analyzing the distribution of these statistics on a dotplot, students observe that they tend to cluster around the true population parameter (the percentage for the whole class). The lesson concludes by explaining that even though the exact population parameter is often unknown (like the true percentage of all US teens who met friends online), random samples allow us to make informed estimates about it. This highlights the practical importance of random sampling in statistical inference."

    "title": "Vocabulary: Parameter - Pew Research Center Example",
    "body": "In Unit 3 Lesson 10, the term 'parameter' is defined as any number that summarizes a population. When discussing the Pew Research Center report stating '57% of teens have met new friends online,' the question arises whether this 57% is a parameter. The lesson clarifies that since this percentage was calculated from a sample of 1,060 teens, it is actually a statistic. The true population parameter – the exact percentage of *all* US teenagers who have met friends online – remains unknown because interviewing every single teenager is impractical. The lesson emphasizes that the goal of using samples is to estimate this unknown population parameter."

    "title": "Vocabulary: Statistic - Pew Research Center Example",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 10 defines a 'statistic' as a term used for numbers that summarize a sample. In the context of the Pew Research Center report ('57% of teens have met new friends online'), the 57% is a statistic. This is because it is derived from a specific group of 1,060 teenagers (the sample), not from the entire population of all US teenagers. The lesson illustrates this by having students collect their own samples from the class (the population). Each percentage calculated from these smaller groups of students is a sample statistic. The dotplot created in the lesson visualizes multiple sample statistics, showing their variability."

    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 10, 'We're So Random,' requires specific materials for its activities. These include the 'Populations & Samples' handout (LMR_U3_L10_A), which contains survey results for students to analyze. RStudio is essential for demonstrating and generating random samples using code. A projector is needed to display RStudio functions to the class. A dotplot titled 'Percent of Students Who Have Met Friends Online' is used to record and visualize sample statistics throughout the lesson. Additionally, the 'Parameters & Statistics' handout (LMR_U3_L10_B) is assigned as homework to reinforce the lesson's key concepts."

    "title": "Unit 3 Lesson 10: RStudio Sampling Function",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 10 introduces students to using RStudio for creating random samples. The core function demonstrated is `sample(1:N, size = 10, replace = FALSE)`. In this command, `1:N` represents the range of identifiers for the population (e.g., student numbers from 1 to N, where N is the total number of students in the class). `size = 10` specifies that a sample of 10 individuals should be selected. The argument `replace = FALSE` is crucial because it ensures that once an individual is selected for the sample, they cannot be selected again, meaning sampling is done without replacement. This function is used to select students for the sample, after which their relevant data (e.g., whether they have met friends online) is collected."
