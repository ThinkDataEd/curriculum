    "title": "Abstract of Lesson 6: Observational Studies",
    "body": "This lesson introduces observational studies as a data collection method where subjects are observed and outcomes recorded without researcher intervention. Students will learn to collect this type of data and make informal inferences. The lesson uses \"Stick Figures Cutouts\" from Unit 1, Lesson 2, and a \"Turning Observations into Data\" handout. Key vocabulary includes \"observational study.\" Essential concepts emphasize that observational studies involve no intervention by researchers. The lesson guides students through activities involving data collection, variable identification, and analysis of potential relationships, such as the correlation between GPA and the number of social media friends. It contrasts observational studies with experiments, highlighting the lack of group assignment and treatment application in the former. The objective is for students to understand the nature of observational studies and their limitations."

    "title": "Objective of Unit 3 Lesson 6: Observational Studies",
    "body": "The primary objective of Unit 3, Lesson 6 is for students to understand what an observational study is. This involves recognizing it as a data collection method where subjects are observed and their outcomes are recorded. Furthermore, students will gain practical skills in collecting data using this method and learn to draw informal inferences based on the recorded results."

  {
    "title": "Materials for Unit 3 Lesson 6: Observational Studies",
    "body": "The materials required for Unit 3, Lesson 6 are: 1. Stick Figures Cutouts: These are sourced from Unit 1, Lesson 2 (LMR_U1_L2). Advance preparation includes cutting the handout into 8 cards per set. Enough sets are needed for each student team to have one full set. 2. Turning Observations into Data handout (LMR_U3_L6): This handout is distributed one copy per student."

  {
    "title": "Vocabulary: Observational Study",
    "body": "An observational study is a data collection method where subjects are observed, and their outcomes are recorded. In this type of study, researchers do not intervene or apply any treatments to the subjects. They simply watch and record what happens."
  },
  {
    "title": "Essential Concepts of Observational Studies",
    "body": "Observational studies are characterized by the absence of any intervention applied by the researchers. This means that subjects are studied in their natural environment, and researchers do not manipulate any variables or assign subjects to different conditions. The focus is purely on observing and recording existing phenomena."
  },
  {
    "title": "Lesson Procedure: Distributing Stick Figure Cards",
    "body": "The lesson begins by having students recall their work from Unit 1, Lesson 2, where they used the 'Stick Figures' cards (LMR_U1_L2). Each student team receives a full set of 8 cards. Previously, data was collected and recorded from these cards, but without a structured approach. This redistribution serves as a refresher and prepares them for the current lesson's focus on structured observation and data analysis."
  },
  {
    "title": "Lesson Procedure: Turning Observations into Data Handout",
    "body": "Following the distribution of the 'Stick Figures' cards, each student receives a copy of the 'Turning Observations into Data' handout (LMR_U3_L6). Students are instructed to work individually on this handout, selecting one card from their team's pile. This handout guides them through the process of transforming observations from the cards into structured data, preparing them for analysis and inference."
  },
  {
    "title": "Lesson Procedure: Individual Work and Team Comparison",
    "body": "After receiving the 'Turning Observations into Data' handout, each student selects one 'Stick Figures' card and begins working through the handout independently. Once a student completes a section of the handout, they are encouraged to compare their responses with other members of their student team. This promotes collaborative learning and allows for the identification of any discrepancies or common understandings."
  },
  {
    "title": "Lesson Procedure: Variable Identification and Sharing",
    "body": "The lesson progresses to a guided discussion on the variables presented in Part 1 of the 'Turning Observations into Data' handout. A 'Whip Around' activity is conducted by teams to identify these variables. Subsequently, a few teams are selected to share their findings, focusing on the information in the first row and one of the columns of their data, reinforcing the understanding of variable identification."
  },
  {
    "title": "Lesson Procedure: Research Question and Social Media Friends",
    "body": "Part 3 of the handout introduces a specific research question: 'What determines the number of friends a person has on social media?' Students are prompted to consider this question after completing the handout. The subsequent discussion focuses on the variables they identified as being best associated with the number of friends, guiding them towards the observation that GPA may be related, with higher GPAs potentially correlating with more friends."
  },
  {
    "title": "Lesson Procedure: Exploring Confounding Variables",
    "body": "Students are asked to address the final question on the handout: 'Can you think of another variable (not necessarily given in the pictures) that might impact both the number of friends AND the variable you selected? Give an example and explain how it might impact each of the variables.' This encourages critical thinking about potential confounding variables. An example provided is 'a person's self-esteem level,' explaining its potential impact on both grades and the number of friends."
  },
  {
    "title": "Lesson Procedure: Comparing Observational Studies to Experiments",
    "body": "Students are reminded of their prior learning about experiments. In their teams, they discuss the similarities and differences between collecting data for an observational study and conducting an experiment. A whole-class discussion follows, emphasizing that in observational studies, there is no assignment to groups and no treatment is applied. Subjects are simply observed, and information is recorded, distinguishing it clearly from experimental designs."
  },
  {
    "title": "Lesson Procedure: Defining Observational Study",
    "body": "To consolidate learning, students are formally informed that an 'observational study' is a data collection method where subjects are observed and outcomes are recorded. Crucially, no treatment is applied by the researchers, who have no control over the situation. They are essentially watching events unfold and documenting them."
  },
  {
    "title": "Looking Ahead: Unit 3 Lesson 7",
    "body": "Unit 3, Lesson 7 will build upon the concepts introduced in this lesson. Students will delve deeper into the distinctions between experiments and observational studies. They will also learn about the types of conclusions that can be drawn from each of these study designs, further refining their understanding of data collection and analysis methodologies."
  },
  {
    "title": "Class Scribes Activity",
    "body": "As a concluding activity for Unit 3, Lesson 6, one student team will be designated as 'Class Scribes.' This team will be responsible for preparing and delivering a brief presentation to the class. Their presentation will focus on identifying and discussing what they consider to be the three most important topics covered during the lesson on observational studies."
