    "title": "Abstract: Creating a Participatory Sensing Campaign",
    "body": "This lesson focuses on guiding students through the process of creating their own Participatory Sensing campaign and survey. Students will analyze existing campaign structures, like the 'Food Habits' campaign, to understand the relationship between survey questions, triggers, and data collection. The core objective is to have the class collaboratively decide on a topic of interest, a research question, and a trigger event for a new campaign. This process involves teamwork, discussion, and consensus-building within student groups and then as a whole class. Essential concepts include understanding that survey questions in a campaign are triggered and that research questions guide the overall direction. The lesson also differentiates between surveys and Participatory Sensing campaigns based on data collection frequency and duration. Students will use provided handouts for brainstorming and campaign creation. The lesson concludes with a homework assignment to categorize the newly created campaign and justify the choice."

    "title": "Lesson 17: Creating Our Own Participatory Sensing Campaign",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 17 guides students in creating a new Participatory Sensing campaign and survey. The objective is for the class to collaboratively design a campaign on a topic of shared interest. Key materials include handouts for 'Food Habits Campaign Questions' and 'Campaign Creation Brainstorm'. The lesson begins with reviewing homework, defining Participatory Sensing, and recalling previous campaigns (Food Habits, Time Use, Stress/Chill). Students learn that 'Personality Color' and 'Time Perception' were surveys, not campaigns, due to single data collection. The core activity involves analyzing the 'Food Habits Campaign Questions' handout to understand how survey-type questions are used in a triggered data collection context. Students then work in teams to brainstorm and select a class-wide topic, research question, and data collection trigger, using the 'Campaign Creation Brainstorm' handout. The process emphasizes consensus and collaboration. Finally, students will classify the created campaign based on what or whom it will learn about: Individual, Groups of people, or Community."

    "title": "Essential Concepts: Participatory Sensing Campaign Creation",
    "body": "Creating a Participatory Sensing Campaign involves specific considerations for survey questions and research direction. A fundamental principle is that survey questions within a campaign must be completed whenever they are 'triggered' by a specific event or condition. This repeated, triggered data collection distinguishes campaigns from one-off surveys. Additionally, research questions are crucial as they provide the overall direction and purpose for the entire Participatory Sensing Campaign. They define what the campaign aims to discover or understand. Therefore, effective campaign design integrates clearly defined, triggered survey questions with focused research questions that guide the data collection and interpretation process."

    "title": "Participatory Sensing Definition",
    "body": "Participatory Sensing is fundamentally about data collection and interpretation, with a strong emphasis on citizen and community involvement. It empowers individuals and groups to sense and document their environments where they live, work, and play. This can range from individual observations to aggregating data from large numbers of participants to reveal city-wide patterns. The defining characteristic is that Participatory Sensing begins and ends with people. The nature of the information collected, its organization, and its ultimate use can be determined either centrally or collaboratively by the participants themselves. The latter approach highlights the novelty of Participatory Sensing, particularly its reliance on widely available and familiar technology, underscoring a citizen-powered methodology for understanding the world."

    "title": "Distinguishing Surveys from Participatory Sensing Campaigns",
    "body": "It is important to differentiate between a survey and a Participatory Sensing campaign. While both may use similar questions, the key distinction lies in the frequency and context of data collection. Surveys are typically completed only once, providing a snapshot of information at a specific moment. In contrast, Participatory Sensing campaigns involve collecting data repeatedly over time, triggered by specific events. For example, the 'Personality Color' and 'Time Perception' activities were considered surveys because their data was collected only once. Campaigns like 'Food Habits,' 'Time Use,' and 'Stress/Chill,' however, are considered Participatory Sensing campaigns because data was collected over time, and the questions were likely re-answered based on recurring events or conditions."

    "title": "Analyzing the 'Food Habits Campaign Questions' Handout",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 17 involves analyzing the 'Food Habits Campaign Questions' handout (LMR_U3_L17_A) to understand the structure of a Participatory Sensing campaign. Students, working in teams, examine the number and types of questions, noting if they resemble survey questions. A critical point of discussion is understanding *when* these questions need to be answered. For the 'Food Habits' campaign, the trigger is 'each time they eat a snack.' Students also identify *who* collects the data, which in this case is the participants themselves. This analysis helps students grasp that even survey-like questions can be part of a Participatory Sensing campaign when data is collected repeatedly based on a trigger event."

    "title": "Campaign Creation Process: Topic Selection",
    "body": "As part of creating a new Participatory Sensing campaign in Unit 3 Lesson 17, students engage in a multi-round brainstorming process using the 'Campaign Creation Brainstorm' handout (LMR_U3_L17_B). In Round 1, teams discuss their hobbies, interests, or places they want to learn more about, focusing on aspects of 'where they live, work, or play.' The key requirement is that all group members must agree on a single topic of interest. Examples include practicing cello (hobby), the environment (area of interest), or 'our school' (place of interest). After teams decide on a topic, they share it, and the class collectively chooses one topic to pursue for the new campaign."

  {
    "title": "Campaign Creation Process: Research Question Selection",
    "body": "Following the selection of a class-wide topic in Unit 3 Lesson 17, the campaign creation process moves to Round 2: deciding on a research question. Teams brainstorm potential research questions related to the chosen topic. For instance, if the topic is 'practicing cello,' a research question could be 'How can I improve my playing?' or 'How can I practice more effectively?'. Each team proposes a research question, and then the class collaborates to select a single, unified research question that will guide the new Participatory Sensing campaign. This step ensures the campaign has a clear objective and focus."

  {
    "title": "Campaign Creation Process: Trigger Event Selection",
    "body": "In Round 3 of the campaign creation process for Unit 3 Lesson 17, teams focus on identifying the trigger event that will initiate data collection for the new Participatory Sensing campaign. Students discuss what kind of data is needed to answer the research question and determine the most appropriate trigger. Examples of triggers include 'every day at 8 am,' 'whenever they practice the cello,' or 'whenever they see an advertisement.' For a cello-related campaign, a trigger might be 'whenever you play the cello,' which could occur multiple times a day. Teams share their proposed triggers, and the class collectively decides on a single trigger for the campaign."

    "title": "Homework: Classifying the Participatory Sensing Campaign",
    "body": "The homework assignment for Unit 3 Lesson 17 requires students to classify the newly created class Participatory Sensing campaign. Using the agreed-upon class topic, research question, trigger event, and data collection plan, students must categorize the campaign as (A) Individual, (B) Groups of people, or (C) Community. They must provide a justification for their chosen category. The guideline for classification is based on the question 'Who or what will we learn about?'. If the answer is 'only one person' (e.g., a cello campaign), it's Individual. If it involves learning about 'lots of people' (e.g., Food Habits, Time Use campaigns involving the class), it's Groups of people. Campaigns focused on broader societal or environmental issues (e.g., mapping churches, preventing littering) fall under the Community category."

    "title": "Handout: Food Habits Campaign Questions (LMR_U3_L17_A)",
    "body": "The 'Food Habits Campaign Questions' handout (LMR_U3_L17_A) serves as a practical example for students in Unit 3 Lesson 17 to analyze the components of a Participatory Sensing campaign. It contains the specific questions used in the Food Habits campaign. During the lesson, students examine this handout to understand the nature of the questions (e.g., survey-type, open-ended, single-choice), determine when the questions are triggered (e.g., every time a snack is eaten), and identify who collects the data (the participants). Analyzing this handout helps students deconstruct how survey elements are integrated into a continuous, triggered data collection process characteristic of Participatory Sensing."
