    "title": "Abstract: Lesson 9 - Survey Says...",
    "body": "This lesson introduces surveys as a data collection method. Students will learn what a survey is, the types of questions used (open-ended and closed-ended), and how surveys are conducted. The lesson utilizes a clip from the TV show 'Family Feud' to illustrate the concept of surveying a population and collecting responses. Activities include analyzing survey data from the show, defining survey terms, differentiating question types, and practicing the design of survey questions using a handout. The core idea is that surveys gather self-reported data through carefully worded questions to answer statistical questions, forming a part of the Data Cycle."

    "title": "Unit 3 Lesson 9: Introduction to Surveys",
    "body": "This lesson, Unit 3 Lesson 9, focuses on surveys as a primary method for data collection. The objective is for students to understand what a survey entails, the different kinds of questions employed (open-ended and closed-ended), and the process of conducting a survey. To engage students, a video clip from 'Family Feud' demonstrating a survey-based game segment ('Fast Money') is used. Students are prompted to analyze the survey data presented in the video, including the number of people surveyed, the sample population, and the meaning of the 'survey said' results. This sets the stage for understanding surveys as a tool for gathering self-reported data."

    "title": "Family Feud as a Survey Example",
    "body": "The television game show 'Family Feud' serves as a practical example to introduce the concept of surveys in Unit 3 Lesson 9. The 'Fast Money' segment requires contestants to guess the most common answers to survey questions. This highlights that surveys involve asking questions to a sample population to determine popular responses. Students are asked to identify key details from a video clip, such as the number of people surveyed (100), the demographic of the surveyed group (e.g., single men), the number of questions asked (5), and the interpretation of 'survey said' results, which represent the frequency of specific answers from the surveyed population."

    "title": "Vocabulary: Survey",
    "body": "A **survey** is a data collection method. It involves an investigation into the characteristics of a given population by collecting data from a sample of that population. The characteristics of the population are then estimated using systematic statistical methodology. In Unit 3 Lesson 9, understanding the definition of a survey is fundamental to grasping how data is gathered and analyzed."
  },
  {
    "title": "Vocabulary: Self-Reported Data",
    "body": "In the context of surveys, **self-reported** data refers to information provided directly by the participants themselves. This means that individuals answer questions about their own experiences, opinions, or characteristics. This method is central to how surveys function, as they rely on the honesty and accuracy of the respondents' answers. Unit 3 Lesson 9 emphasizes this aspect when defining a survey as a method where data are self-reported."
  },
  {
    "title": "Vocabulary: Open-Ended Questions",
    "body": "**Open-ended questions** are a type of survey question that allows participants to provide a free-response answer. These questions do not limit the respondent to a set of predefined choices, instead offering a text approach where individuals can elaborate in their own words. Examples include 'Write a paragraph' or 'Comments'. Understanding open-ended questions is crucial for designing surveys that can capture detailed qualitative data, as covered in Unit 3 Lesson 9."
  },
  {
    "title": "Vocabulary: Closed-Ended Questions",
    "body": "**Closed-ended questions** are a type of survey question that provides a fixed set of choices for the respondent to select from. These questions offer a structured response format, making data analysis more straightforward. Examples include multiple-choice questions, Yes/No questions, or rating scales (e.g., 'On a scale from 1 to 5'). Unit 3 Lesson 9 highlights the importance of recognizing and utilizing closed-ended questions for efficient data collection."
  },
  {
    "title": "Essential Concepts of Surveys",
    "body": "The essential concepts of surveys, as presented in Unit 3 Lesson 9, emphasize their role in data collection for answering statistical questions. Surveys achieve this by asking simple, straightforward questions. While the goal is clarity, the process of formulating effective survey questions can be challenging. These questions are designed to gather specific information from a sample that can then be used to infer characteristics about a larger population."
  },
  {
    "title": "Lesson Activity: Analyzing 'Family Feud' Data",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 9 uses a 'Family Feud' video clip to illustrate survey concepts. After watching, students record answers to specific questions in their journals: How many people were surveyed (typically 100)? Who was represented (e.g., single men)? How many questions were asked (usually 5)? And crucially, what does 'survey said' signify? It means a certain number of the surveyed individuals gave that particular response. This activity helps solidify the understanding of survey mechanics and data interpretation."
  },
  {
    "title": "Understanding Surveys: Individual and Partner Activity",
    "body": "Following the analysis of the 'Family Feud' video in Unit 3 Lesson 9, students engage in a discussion about surveys. First, they individually write down what they know about surveys in their journals. Subsequently, they pair up to share their individual thoughts with a partner. A few students are then selected to share their combined insights with the entire class. This collaborative approach helps activate prior knowledge and build a shared understanding of surveys before formal instruction begins."
  },
  {
    "title": "Components of a Survey",
    "body": "A survey, as defined in Unit 3 Lesson 9, is a data collection method utilizing self-reported information. It comprises three key components: 1) A questionnaire, which is a series of questions designed to gather specific data. 2) A representative sample of the population of interest, ensuring the collected data can be generalized. 3) Carefully worded questions that are clear, unambiguous, and relevant to the research objective. Understanding these components is vital for designing effective surveys."
  },
  {
    "title": "Types of Survey Questions: Practice Activity",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 9 includes an activity where students categorize question types as either open-ended or closed-ended. They are presented with a list including 'Multiple choice,' 'Write a paragraph,' 'Yes/No,' 'Comments,' 'Essays,' 'On a scale from 1 to 5,' 'Choose from a list,' 'Write a sentence,' and 'Check a box.' Students work in pairs to classify each type. This exercise reinforces the distinction between questions that allow free responses (open-ended) and those that provide fixed choices (closed-ended), aiding in the development of effective survey design skills."
  },
  {
    "title": "The Data Cycle Reminder",
    "body": "During Unit 3 Lesson 9, the lesson briefly reviews the Data Cycle. While not elaborated upon in detail within this specific segment, its inclusion serves as a reminder of the broader context in which surveys operate. The Data Cycle typically involves formulating questions, collecting data (often through methods like surveys), analyzing the data, and interpreting the results to draw conclusions. This reinforces that survey design and execution are integral steps within a larger statistical process."

  {
    "title": "Activity: Designing a Survey - Class Practice",
    "body": "To introduce the practical aspect of conducting surveys in Unit 3 Lesson 9, the class works through a scenario to answer the research question: 'What are ‘families’ in the United States?' Students use the 'Designing a Survey' handout. They fill in the 'Research Topic' as 'Families' and the 'Research Question' as stated. The left side of the handout is completed collaboratively as a class, guiding students through the initial steps of survey design, such as brainstorming related statistical questions and drafting initial survey questions."
  },
  {
    "title": "Brainstorming Statistical and Survey Questions",
    "body": "In Unit 3 Lesson 9, after defining the research topic and question ('What are ‘families’ in the United States?'), students brainstorm related statistical questions. A possible example provided is 'What is the typical family size in the United States?' This statistical question guides the creation of survey questions. Students then determine three survey questions to help answer the statistical question, ensuring they are unambiguous and relevant. Examples like 'How many siblings do you have?' and 'How many people live with you?' are considered, noting that different definitions of 'family' will influence question design."
  },
  {
    "title": "Drafting Survey Questions: Clarity and Relevance",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 9 emphasizes the importance of crafting clear and relevant survey questions. When developing questions to answer a statistical question (e.g., 'What is the typical family size?'), the goal is to avoid ambiguity. For instance, the question 'How many siblings do you have?' might need clarification regarding half-siblings or step-siblings. The lesson suggests that sometimes collecting preliminary data (like responses to 'How many siblings do you have?') can reveal vagueness and prompt revisions, ensuring the questions effectively address the statistical inquiry."
  },
  {
    "title": "Team Activity: Survey Design",
    "body": "After the class-wide practice in Unit 3 Lesson 9, students work in teams to continue the survey design activity. Each team must develop a statistical question related to the main research question ('What are ‘families’ in the United States?') and then create three corresponding survey questions. The teams are instructed to include both open-ended and closed-ended questions in their survey design, and each of the three questions should represent a different type (e.g., multiple choice, write a sentence, yes/no). Teams then share their developed questions with the class."
  },
  {
    "title": "Homework: Rewriting Survey Questions",
    "body": "The homework assignment for Unit 3 Lesson 9 requires students to take one survey question developed by their team and rewrite it in three different ways, using three distinct question types (open-ended or closed-ended). For example, if the team question was 'How many siblings do you have?', students would rewrite it as a multiple-choice question, a 'write a paragraph' question, and a 'Yes/No' question. This reinforces the understanding of different question formats and their application in survey design."
  },
  {
    "title": "Class Scribes: Key Takeaways",
    "body": "In Unit 3 Lesson 9, a designated team of students takes on the role of 'Class Scribes.' Their task is to discuss and present what they believe were the three most important topics covered during the lesson. This activity encourages critical reflection on the material and helps synthesize the key learning points of the lesson on surveys, data collection, and question design for the rest of the class."
