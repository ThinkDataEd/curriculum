    "title": "Enduring Understandings: Sensors and Triggers",
    "body": "Sensors are fundamentally data collection devices. They operate in two primary modes: collecting data continuously or responding to a 'trigger' to initiate data collection. A sensor is defined as a converter; it measures a physical quantity and transforms it into a signal that can be interpreted by either a person (observer) or a machine (instrument). Within this context, Participatory Sensing is presented as a specialized method for data collection that leverages sensor technology. A key characteristic of Participatory Sensing is its emphasis on the active participation of individuals and community groups in the process of sensing and documenting their environments. Triggers are crucial components in Participatory Sensing, acting as the signals that initiate a data collection event. It's important to note that the response to these triggers might not always be identical; variability is possible."

    "title": "Learning Objectives: Data Science",
    "body": "From a data science perspective, students will grasp key concepts related to sensor data. They will understand that sensors can provide a continuous stream of data, offering a constant flow of information. Participatory Sensing is highlighted as a method that yields real-time data, contributed willingly by a user. A distinguishing feature of sensors as a data gathering method is the utilization of a 'trigger', which serves to signal the commencement of a data collection session. This trigger mechanism is central to initiating data capture in many sensor applications."

    "title": "Concept: Sensor Functionality",
    "body": "Sensors are devices designed for data collection. Their operation can be characterized by two main modes: continuous data collection, where they gather information constantly, or triggered data collection, where they activate and record data only when a specific event or condition occurs. Fundamentally, a sensor acts as a converter. It measures a physical quantity, such as temperature, pressure, or motion, and transforms this measurement into a signal. This signal is designed to be interpretable, either by a human observer or by an electronic instrument, allowing the collected data to be processed and understood."

    "title": "Concept: Participatory Sensing",
    "body": "Participatory Sensing is a specific methodology for collecting data that leverages sensor technology. Its defining characteristic is the active involvement of citizens and community members in the data collection process. This approach emphasizes the contributions of individuals in documenting aspects of their daily lives, workplaces, and recreational activities. In essence, it empowers people to be both the collectors and providers of data about their own environments. This method often relies on mobile devices and their built-in sensors."
  },
  {
    "title": "Concept: Triggers in Data Collection",
    "body": "Triggers play a pivotal role in the process of Participatory Sensing and other sensor-based data collection methods. A trigger is an event or condition that signals the sensor or system to begin or cease data collection. For instance, a GPS sensor might be triggered by movement, or a light sensor might be triggered when ambient light falls below a certain threshold. The response to a trigger in a data collection session is not always uniform; the data captured or the action taken upon sensing the trigger can vary from one instance to another, introducing an element of dynamic behavior to the data collection process."

  {
    "title": "Decision Making: Surveys vs. Sensors",
    "body": "A key learning objective involves students developing the critical thinking skill to determine the most appropriate method for data collection in different scenarios. Specifically, they will learn to 'determine when it is appropriate to use surveys or sensors.' This involves understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each method. Surveys are typically used for gathering opinions, attitudes, or self-reported behaviors from a sample of individuals, often at a specific point in time. Sensors, on the other hand, are better suited for collecting objective, continuous, or event-driven data about physical phenomena or user actions in real-time or near real-time."
