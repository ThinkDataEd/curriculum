    "title": "Unit 3 Lesson 1: Anecdotes vs. Data",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 1 emphasizes that data is superior to anecdotes for making sound scientific conclusions. Anecdotes, which are personal stories or isolated examples, can be unreliable due to personal bias, selective presentation of information to support a specific viewpoint, and often do not represent the general trend or population. Scientific inquiry requires rigorous examination of evidence quality, favoring empirical data over subjective accounts to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions."

    "title": "Unit 3 Lesson 2: What is an Experiment?",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 2 defines a controlled experiment as a scientific method to determine cause-and-effect relationships. Key features include: 1. Identifying a treatment variable (what is manipulated) and a response variable (what is measured to see if it changes). 2. Including a comparison or control group that does not receive the treatment. 3. Randomly assigning subjects to either the treatment or control group (randomized assignment). 4. Ensuring subjects are unaware of their group assignment ('blind'), potentially using a placebo for the control group. 5. Ensuring those measuring the response are also unaware of group assignments ('double blind' if both 4 and 5 are met). These elements help isolate the effect of the treatment variable."

    "title": "Unit 3 Lesson 8: Confounding Factors in Observational Studies",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 8 addresses the challenges posed by confounding factors (or variables) in observational studies. These are extraneous variables that are related to both the potential cause (independent variable) and the effect (dependent variable) being studied. Confounding factors make it difficult to determine a true cause-and-effect relationship because they can create spurious associations, leading to potentially misleading conclusions."

  {
    "title": "Unit 3 Lesson 11: Statistical Bias and Unbiased Estimates",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 11 explains that statistics, derived from samples, naturally vary from sample to sample. An 'unbiased' statistic is one whose typical value across many samples equals the true population parameter. Bias occurs when a sampling method or measurement process consistently misses the mark, leading to systematically inaccurate estimates. Failing to use random sampling is a common way to introduce bias."

    "title": "Unit 3 Lesson 13: Confidence Intervals",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 13 addresses the inherent uncertainty present when estimating population parameters from sample data. It proposes that instead of providing a single point estimate, it is more informative and accurate to provide a range of plausible values. This range, known as a confidence interval, better reflects the uncertainty associated with the estimation process."
  },
  {
    "title": "Unit 3 Lesson 14: Margin of Error",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 14 explains the concept of the margin of error. The margin of error quantifies the uncertainty associated with a sample statistic used to estimate a population parameter. By adding and subtracting the margin of error from the sample estimate, we obtain an interval. We can be highly confident (e.g., 95% confident) that the true population parameter lies within this calculated interval."
