    "title": "Abstract of the Introduction to Data Science Curriculum",
    "body": "The Introduction to Data Science (IDS) curriculum, version 7.2, is a comprehensive program developed under the National Science Foundation's MOBILIZE grant. It aims to teach students about the role of data in science and everyday life, empowering them to think critically and creatively. The curriculum, initiated as a pilot in 2014 with LAUSD teachers, emphasizes Participatory Sensing (PS) campaigns where students use mobile devices to collect and analyze real-world data from their communities. This approach allows students to explore computer science and statistics concepts through hands-on data analysis, fostering scientific inquiry and discovery. The IDS curriculum aligns with Common Core State Standards for High School Statistics and Probability and guides students to understand data's use in addressing real-world problems, analyzing statistical graphics, and evaluating data collection processes and findings. It highlights that various forms of data, including photos, words, and sounds, can provide valuable insights. The program has expanded beyond its initial implementation and is available internationally."

    "title": "The MOBILIZE Project: Innovation in Data Science Education",
    "body": "Mobilize, a partnership established in 2010 between UCLA and LAUSD and funded by the National Science Foundation, aimed to develop innovative curricula in science, mathematics, and computer science. The core objective was to teach students to think critically and creatively about the role of data in science and everyday life. A key feature of the Mobilize curricula is the use of Participatory Sensing (PS) campaigns. In these campaigns, students leverage their mobile devices to collect and share data related to their community and personal lives. By analyzing this collected data, students gain a deeper understanding of their world. Mobilize broke traditional educational barriers by enabling students to apply computer science and statistics concepts to science and mathematics learning. Each class's unique data collection efforts allowed for personalized discoveries, making the learning process dynamic and engaging. Mobile devices were intentionally integrated not as mere novelties but as essential tools for bringing scientific inquiry into students' daily experiences."

    "title": "Introduction to Data Science (IDS) Curriculum Origins and Goals",
    "body": "The Introduction to Data Science (IDS) curriculum was first implemented in 2014, stemming from the MOBILIZE grant initiative which fostered a partnership between UCLA and LAUSD. Initially launched as a pilot program involving 10 LAUSD mathematics teachers, the curriculum has since expanded its reach nationally and internationally. IDS is designed to align with the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) for High School Statistics and Probability. Beyond the standards, the curriculum aims to equip students with a comprehensive understanding of data science, including: recognizing the pervasive use of data in professional fields and all aspects of modern life; understanding how data supports scientific discovery and the tackling of real-world problems in communities; developing the ability to analyze statistical graphics for pattern identification and real-world connection; appreciating that diverse data types (photos, words, sounds) yield insights; and learning practical data analysis skills such as formulating questions based on variable relationships, generating hypotheses from collected data, critically evaluating data and collection methods, and informally testing hypotheses with available data."

    "title": "Participatory Sensing (PS) in the MOBILIZE Grant",
    "body": "The MOBILIZE grant, a collaboration between UCLA and LAUSD, focused on developing innovative science, mathematics, and computer science curricula. A central methodology employed was Participatory Sensing (PS). From 2011 to 2014, the grant supported summer institutes for LAUSD high school teachers in mathematics, science, and computer science. These institutes aimed to train teachers in using PS methods, tools, and materials. The goal was to deepen teachers' understanding of computer science (CS) concepts and to enhance their capacity to support student learning in CS, math, and science. Participatory Sensing, as implemented through the MOBILIZE grant, provided a framework for students to actively engage with data collection using their mobile devices, bringing real-world scientific inquiry into the classroom and their everyday lives."

    "title": "Key Learning Objectives of the IDS Curriculum",
    "body": "The Introduction to Data Science (IDS) curriculum, aligned with Common Core State Standards for High School Statistics and Probability, offers several key learning objectives. Students are guided to understand the critical role data plays in professional contexts and across all facets of modern life. They learn how data empowers scientific endeavors to identify and address real-world challenges within communities. A significant focus is placed on developing analytical skills, such as interpreting statistical graphics to discern patterns and relate them back to the real world. The curriculum emphasizes that various forms of information, including photos, words, and sounds, can be treated as data to gain valuable insights. Furthermore, students acquire practical data analysis competencies, including posing relevant questions based on data relationships, formulating hypotheses for future data collection, critically evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of data and collection processes, and informally assessing hypotheses using existing data."

    "title": "Data Analysis Skills Taught in IDS",
    "body": "The Introduction to Data Science (IDS) curriculum cultivates essential data analysis skills in students. This includes the ability to formulate meaningful questions that can be addressed by examining relationships among variables within a dataset. Students learn to leverage collected data to generate hypotheses that can guide future data collection efforts. A crucial component of the curriculum is the development of critical evaluation skills, enabling students to assess both the strengths and shortcomings of their data and the processes used to collect it. Finally, IDS teaches students to informally evaluate hypotheses using the data they have at hand. These skills are foundational for scientific inquiry and for understanding the complexities of data in the modern world, preparing students for further study and diverse career paths."

    "title": "Vocabulary: Participatory Sensing (PS)",
    "body": "Participatory Sensing (PS) is a methodology central to the MOBILIZE curriculum, including the Introduction to Data Science (IDS). It involves students using their mobile devices as tools to collect and share data about their community and daily lives. This approach allows for real-world data collection that directly informs scientific inquiry and learning. By engaging in PS campaigns, students actively participate in the data lifecycle, from collection to analysis. This hands-on experience helps them gain a deeper understanding of their environment and the application of data science concepts. The MOBILIZE grant specifically funded training for teachers on PS methods to integrate this approach effectively into their classrooms, bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and practical application."

    "title": "Code Snippet: CSS Styling for Blinking Text",
    "body": "The provided code snippet demonstrates CSS styling used for creating a blinking text effect. This effect is achieved through keyframe animations applied to elements with the class `blink_text`. The animation, named `blinker`, cycles through opacity levels: fully visible (1.0) at 20% and 100% of the animation duration, and partially transparent (0.2) at 50%. This creates a visual alert or emphasis, as seen with the 'Click here' link intended to open content in a new tab. Vendor prefixes (`-moz-` and `-webkit-`) are included for broader browser compatibility. This technique is employed for drawing attention to specific interactive elements within the web-based curriculum documentation."
