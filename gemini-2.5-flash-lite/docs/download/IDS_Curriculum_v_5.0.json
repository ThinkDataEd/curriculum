    "body": "A JavaScript snippet is included to enhance the user experience when viewing the IDS Curriculum v5.0 within an iframe.

When the iframe content has finished loading, this handler ensures that both the document's body and the documentElement's scroll position are reset to the top (0). This prevents any potential display issues or awkward scrolling states immediately after the curriculum content becomes visible."
