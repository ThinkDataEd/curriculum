    "title": "Lab Response Sheet Naming Convention",
    "body": "The Lab Response Sheets (LRS) within the IDS curriculum follow a consistent naming convention to identify the unit and specific lab exercise. The format is 'LRS_XA.pdf', where 'X' denotes the unit number (e.g., 1 for Unit 1, 2 for Unit 2) and 'A' represents the specific lab within that unit (e.g., LRS_1A.pdf is the first lab sheet for Unit 1). This systematic naming allows for straightforward organization and retrieval of lab materials across different units. The version number, such as 7.1, indicates the revision of the lab sheets, ensuring users are referencing the most up-to-date practical guides. These sheets are integral to the IDS curriculum, particularly for version 5.0 and its associated lab materials."
