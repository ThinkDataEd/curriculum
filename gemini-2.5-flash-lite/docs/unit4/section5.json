    "title": "Abstract for Unit 4 Section 5: Ties that Bind",
    "body": "This section introduces two methods for classifying data into groups: clustering and networks. Clustering, specifically using the k-means algorithm, groups observations based on numerical similarities by iteratively determining cluster means. Networks classify people into groups based on relationships, forming nodes where connections exist. The section includes learning objectives covering statistical concepts (S-IC 2), data science principles (understanding RStudio's k-means and network functions), and applied computational thinking using RStudio (using k-means, plotting cluster assignments). Language objectives focus on explaining k-means, comparing personal data, and justifying community recommendations. Data sources include the 'futbol' dataset and student-generated 'TimeUse' campaign data, collected through participatory sensing. Real-world applications of network analysis (NSA) and k-means (country grouping) are highlighted."

    "title": "Enduring Understandings: Clustering and Networks",
    "body": "This section introduces two key methods for data classification: clustering and networks. Clustering is presented as a way to group data based on numerical characteristics and their similarities. The k-means algorithm is specifically mentioned as a technique to determine the mean value for each of k clusters. This process involves randomly assigning initial mean values and then adjusting them based on their proximity to the data points. Networks are introduced as a method for classifying people into groups based on their relationships, where a 'node' is formed when a relationship between two individuals exists."

    "title": "Engagement: Grouping Football Players and Swimmers",
    "body": "The engagement activity for this section involves students applying the concept of clustering to a practical scenario. Students will be presented with a plot of data points. Their task is to determine which points should be grouped together as 'football players' and which should be grouped as 'swimmers.' This grouping will be based on identifying clusters within the characteristics represented by the data points on the plot, visually demonstrating the principle of clustering."

    "title": "Learning Objective: Statistical - S-IC 2",
    "body": "A key statistical learning objective for this section is S-IC 2.

    "title": "Language Objective 1: Explaining K-means Clustering",
    "body": "The first language objective focuses on students' ability to articulate their understanding of k-means clustering. Students will be required to write an explanation of what k-means clustering is, using their own words. This encourages them to process the information and express it in a clear and comprehensible manner, demonstrating a grasp of the core concept."

    "title": "Language Objective 2: Describing Data Differences",
    "body": "The second language objective challenges students to analyze and describe differences between two specific data sets collected from their own class. They will focus on comparing the 'time spent on videogames' and 'time spent on homework.' This involves interpreting their collected data and articulating the variations observed between these two activities."

  {
    "title": "Language Objective 3: Justifying Community Recommendations",
    "body": "The third language objective requires students to synthesize their learning and apply it to a community context. They will create visualizations and numerical summaries to support their findings. Using these outputs, students will orally and in writing, justify a recommendation aimed at improving their community, demonstrating the practical application of data analysis and communication skills."

    "title": "Vocabulary: Clustering",
    "body": "Clustering is a method used to classify data into groups. Observations are grouped based on their numerical characteristics and how similar these characteristics are. The goal is to partition data points into distinct clusters such that points within the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. K-means is a common algorithm used for this purpose."

  {
    "title": "Vocabulary: K-means Algorithm",
    "body": "The k-means algorithm is a method used for clustering data. It works by determining the mean value for each of k clusters. The process begins with randomly assigning an initial value for the mean of each cluster. Subsequently, the mean of each cluster is adjusted based on its proximity to the data points assigned to that cluster. This iterative process continues until the cluster assignments stabilize."

    "title": "Vocabulary: Networks (in data classification)",
    "body": "In the context of data classification, networks are used to group people based on their relationships, specifically 'who knows whom.' A 'node' is formed in a network when a relationship between two individuals is present. This approach allows for the analysis of social structures and connections within a dataset."
  },
  {
    "title": "Vocabulary: Node (in networks)",
    "body": "In the context of network analysis for data classification, a 'node' represents an individual or entity within the network. Nodes are formed when a relationship exists between two people. These nodes are the fundamental building blocks of a network, and the connections between them represent the relationships being studied."
