    "title": "Lesson Activity: Topic and Research Question Development",
    "body": "In Unit 4 Lesson 3, students begin by deciding on a topic and research question for their Team Participatory Sensing Campaign. They will review provided articles to select at least one that sets the context for a real-world problem they aim to address. A crucial aspect of this process is verifying the reliability of sources to avoid spreading misinformation. The lesson introduces the SIFT method as a strategy for checking source credibility."

    "title": "SIFT Method for Source Credibility",
    "body": "The SIFT method is a strategy for checking the credibility of online sources, adapted from Michael A. Caulfield's work. It involves four key steps: **Stop**: Before reading or sharing, assess if you know and trust the source. If you get lost in links, stop and refocus on your goal. **Investigate the Source**: Determine the origin of the information by performing searches (e.g., Google, Wikipedia) on unfamiliar sources. A video tutorial is available for this step. **Find Trusted Coverage**: Verify claims by searching for relevant stories on news sites and fact-checking organizations (like snopes.com, factcheck.org, politifact.com). For images and videos, use reverse image searches to check validity and context. A video guides users through verifying images and videos. **Trace claims, quotes, and media back to the original context**: Identify if the information is being re-reported or commented upon, indicated by phrases like 'As reported by...'. A video is provided to assist in finding the original source."

    "title": "Participatory Sensing vs. Surveys in Unit 4 Lesson 3",
    "body": "During Unit 4 Lesson 3, students are prompted to consider when a Participatory Sensing campaign is more appropriate than a traditional survey. Through a Pair-Share activity, they discuss this distinction. The key difference highlighted is that Participatory Sensing campaigns are ideal for research questions involving variation across time or location, requiring data collection at multiple points. A trigger is necessary to record observations at these different times and places. If a question only needs to be answered once, a survey is generally a more suitable method."

    "title": "Team Campaign Creation and Topic Selection in Unit 4 Lesson 3",
    "body": "In Unit 4 Lesson 3, students transition from a whole-class campaign (Unit 3) to creating individual team campaigns focused on community concerns or interests. Teams are provided with the 'Team Campaign Creation' handout. The remainder of the class is dedicated to finding and reviewing articles to serve as the foundation for their campaigns. Students are expected to decide on a topic during this session, with campaign creation continuing in the next class. The instructor facilitates brainstorming and checks for understanding, offering suggested articles and data files for inspiration, such as those related to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, droughts, homelessness, and mental health."

    "title": "Resource: Great Pacific Garbage Patch Article and Data",
    "body": "One of the suggested resources for Unit 4 Lesson 3 is the article 'Great Pacific Garbage Patch: The World's Biggest Landfill in the Pacific Ocean' (found at https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/oceanography/great-pacific-garbage-patch.htm). This article aligns with topics related to trash, potentially discussed in earlier lessons. Supporting data for this topic can be found in the 'US Landfills' data file, available on the EPA's LMOP website (https://www.epa.gov/lmop/landfill-technical-data). This pairing of an article and data file offers students a concrete starting point for research on an environmental issue."
