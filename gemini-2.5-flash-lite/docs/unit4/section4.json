    "title": "Enduring Understandings: Decision Trees",
    "body": "Decision trees are a powerful tool for classifying observations into similar groups based on their characteristics. The process involves asking a series of questions, and observations are sorted according to the answers. This iterative process, also known as classification and regression trees (CART), continues until a final group membership is determined. CART is a specific modeling technique used for creating these decision trees."
