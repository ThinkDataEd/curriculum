    "body": "Unit 4 Lesson 16 introduces students to decision trees as a non-linear method for classifying data. The lesson's objective is for students to understand the structure of decision trees and how they are used for classification. Through an interactive activity involving player statistics and a series of questions represented by nodes, students will experience how modifications to a decision tree can significantly impact its accuracy. The lesson contrasts decision trees with linear models and introduces Classification and Regression Trees (CART). Key vocabulary includes classify, decision tree, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), and nodes. The lesson culminates in a comparative analysis of two different decision tree structures and a discussion on optimizing classification accuracy."

    "title": "Introduction to Decision Trees for Classification - Unit 4 Lesson 16",
    "body": "Unit 4 Lesson 16 begins by posing a thought-provoking question to students: who would they trust more for a diagnosis of chest pains, a data scientist or a doctor? This leads into a discussion about Lee Goldman's decision tree developed in the late 1970s for diagnosing heart attacks, which proved to be more accurate than individual doctor diagnoses. The lesson displays a sample \"Decision Tree for Heart Attack Risk\" ([LMR_U4_L16_A]) to illustrate the concept. Students engage in a \"Pair-Share\" activity to discuss their initial understanding of what decision trees are and how they classify data. The lesson emphasizes that while previous topics focused on linear models, real-world data often requires non-linear approaches, which decision trees provide. Decision trees are described as a tool for classifying observations into groups when trends are non-linear, and they are 'grown' using algorithms to find the best predictive model."

    "title": "Decision Trees: Structure and Function - Unit 4 Lesson 16",
    "body": "Decision trees function by posing a series of sequential questions. Observations navigate through the tree, starting at the root node, and follow different branches based on their answers to subsequent questions. This process continues until a leaf node is reached, where the observation is assigned to one of several possible classifications. Unit 4 Lesson 16 explains that algorithms are used to explore many possible decision paths and identify the most effective ones. The lesson introduces the goal of classifying professional athletes into either soccer players on the US Men's National Team or football players in the National Football League (NFL). This classification is performed using a method known as CART (Classification and Regression Trees), which encompasses both classification trees (predicting categorical variables) and regression trees (predicting numerical values)."

    "title": "CART Activity: Classifying Athletes - Round 1 - Unit 4 Lesson 16",
    "body": "Unit 4 Lesson 16 features a hands-on \"CART Activity\" designed to demonstrate how decision trees work. Fifteen student volunteers, acting as \"players,\" are given data cards ([LMR_U4_L16_B]) containing athlete statistics (team location, name, age, height, weight, league). Seven other students act as \"nodes\" (root, internal, and leaf nodes) and are given questions from \"CART Activity Round 1 Questions\" ([LMR_U4_L16_C]). Players proceed through the nodes based on their \"yes\" or \"no\" answers until classified as a soccer or NFL football player. After Round 1, the classification accuracy is recorded. In this round, using a specific set of rules, approximately 40% of players were classified correctly, highlighting the potential for misclassification. This initial round serves as a baseline to understand the effectiveness of a given decision tree structure."

    "title": "CART Activity: Classifying Athletes - Round 2 - Unit 4 Lesson 16",
    "body": "Following the first round of the \"CART Activity\" in Unit 4 Lesson 16, the lesson proceeds to \"Round 2\" to explore how changes in the decision tree structure affect classification accuracy. An additional five students join as nodes, and they are given new questions from the \"CART Activity Round 2 Questions\" ([LMR_U4_L16_D]). The \"players\" then navigate this revised decision tree structure. The results of Round 2 are recorded and analyzed. In this round, with a modified set of questions and branching logic, the classification accuracy significantly improved to approximately 87%. This comparison between Round 1 and Round 2 demonstrates how the specific questions asked and their order within a decision tree can drastically alter its effectiveness in correctly classifying data points."

    "title": "Analyzing Decision Tree Performance and Optimization - Unit 4 Lesson 16",
    "body": "After completing both rounds of the CART activity in Unit 4 Lesson 16, students discuss their findings. They reflect on how decision trees classify individuals by sequentially asking questions and guiding them down specific paths. A key discussion point is comparing the success rates of Round 1 (around 40% correct) and Round 2 (around 87% correct), analyzing why the second round was more successful. The lesson prompts students to consider how to determine the optimal questions and their order to minimize incorrect classifications, also known as misclassifications. This leads to the concept of the misclassification rate (MCR), which will be formally defined in the next lesson. Finally, a \"Class Scribes\" activity has students identify the three most important topics learned, and a homework assignment requires them to find and analyze an online decision tree."

    "title": "Vocabulary: Classify - Unit 4 Lesson 16",
    "body": "In Unit 4 Lesson 16, the term **classify** is a fundamental concept. It refers to the problem of identifying which specific category or group an observation or a set of observations belongs to. In the context of the lesson, this means determining whether a given athlete is a soccer player or an NFL football player. Decision trees are the primary tool used in this lesson to achieve classification. The process involves asking a series of questions that lead an individual or data point down a path within the tree, ultimately assigning it to a predefined classification at a leaf node. Understanding 'classify' is crucial for grasping the purpose and application of decision trees in data analysis."

  {
    "title": "Vocabulary: Decision Tree - Unit 4 Lesson 16",
    "body": "A **decision tree** is a key concept introduced in Unit 4 Lesson 16. It is defined as a decision support tool that utilizes a tree-like model to represent decisions and their potential consequences, including uncertain outcomes. In practical terms, a decision tree works by asking a sequence of questions. Each question represents a node in the tree, and the answers guide the progression through different branches. This process continues until a final classification or prediction is made at a leaf node. The lesson uses examples like the \"Decision Tree for Heart Attack Risk\" to illustrate how these structures can be used to classify entities into distinct groups based on a series of criteria, providing a visual and logical framework for decision-making and data analysis."

    "title": "Vocabulary: Classification and Regression Trees (CART) - Unit 4 Lesson 16",
    "body": "Unit 4 Lesson 16 introduces **Classification and Regression Trees (CART)** as a specific type of predictive algorithm used in machine learning. CART is an umbrella term that encompasses decision trees used for two primary purposes: classification and regression. Classification trees are used when the target variable is categorical, meaning they predict which group an observation belongs to (e.g., soccer player vs. football player). Regression trees, on the other hand, are used when the target variable is numerical, predicting a specific value (e.g., predicting house prices). The lesson focuses on the classification aspect of CART through its interactive activity, demonstrating how these algorithms explain how a target variable's values can be predicted based on other values."

  {
    "title": "Vocabulary: Nodes - Unit 4 Lesson 16",
    "body": "In the context of Unit 4 Lesson 16, **nodes** are fundamental components of a decision tree. They represent points of decision or connection within the tree's structure. There are three main types of nodes: the root node, which is the starting point and poses the initial question or characteristic to split the dataset; internal nodes, which are subsequent questions that further split the data based on answers; and leaf nodes, which are the terminal points of the tree where a final classification or prediction is made, and no further splitting is possible. The CART activity in the lesson involves students physically acting as these nodes, asking questions and directing the \"players\" through the classification process."

    "title": "Essential Concepts: Non-Linear Trends and Decision Trees - Unit 4 Lesson 16",
    "body": "Unit 4 Lesson 16 addresses the essential concept that not all trends in data are linear. Traditional approaches that rely on linear models are insufficient for capturing these non-linear patterns. To address this, the lesson introduces **decision trees** as a powerful non-linear tool. Decision trees are specifically designed to classify observations into different groups when the underlying trend in the data cannot be represented by a straight line or simple equation. This is crucial because, in the real world, data often exhibits complex, non-linear relationships. By using decision trees, students learn a method to model and make predictions on data that linear models cannot adequately handle, expanding their toolkit for data analysis."

    "title": "Decision Tree for Heart Attack Risk Example - Unit 4 Lesson 16",
    "body": "Unit 4 Lesson 16 utilizes the \"Decision Tree for Heart Attack Risk\" graphic ([LMR_U4_L16_A]) as a concrete example to introduce the concept of decision trees. This graphic represents a simplified version of a decision tree developed by cardiologist Lee Goldman in the late 1970s. Goldman's original tree was based on extensive patient data and aimed to diagnose heart attack risk. The lesson highlights that this decision tree achieved over 95% accuracy in correct diagnoses, surpassing the 75-90% accuracy of individual doctors at the time. Displaying this example helps students visualize how a series of questions derived from data can lead to accurate classifications, making the abstract concept of decision trees more tangible and relatable."

    "body": "The \"CART Activity Player Stats\" ([LMR_U4_L16_B]) is a crucial material for Unit 4 Lesson 16's interactive activity. This handout provides data for 15 professional athletes, serving as the observations to be classified. Each athlete's card includes key variables such as team location, name, age, height (in inches), weight (in pounds), and league. These statistics are used by the \"players\" in the activity to answer the questions posed by the \"nodes.\" The data is designed to allow for the creation of a decision tree that attempts to classify athletes into either the US Men's National Soccer Team or the NFL. This handout requires advanced preparation, specifically cutting out the individual player cards for distribution."

    "body": "In Unit 4 Lesson 16, the \"CART Activity Round 1 Questions\" ([LMR_U4_L16_C]) provides the specific decision criteria used in the first iteration of the classification activity. These questions are distributed among the students acting as \"nodes\" in the decision tree. Each question represents a test on one of the variables available from the \"CART Activity Player Stats\" ([LMR_U4_L16_B]). For example, a node might ask, \"Is the player taller than 75 inches?\" Based on the \"player's\" answer (yes or no), they are directed to another node. This set of questions, along with the arrangement of the nodes, forms the initial decision tree structure that students navigate to classify athletes. This handout also requires advanced preparation, with cards needing to be cut out."

    "body": "The \"CART Activity Round 2 Questions\" ([LMR_U4_L16_D]) are essential for the second part of the classification activity in Unit 4 Lesson 16. This handout contains a different set of questions compared to Round 1. These new questions, assigned to the \"nodes,\" form a modified decision tree structure. By using different questions or arranging them in a different order, the activity demonstrates how altering the decision tree can lead to different classification outcomes. This round is designed to show students that even with the same set of player data, a different tree structure can yield significantly higher accuracy. Like the other activity handouts, these question strips require advanced preparation, including cutting them out before the lesson."

    "body": "As a follow-up to Unit 4 Lesson 16, students are assigned homework that requires them to find a decision tree online that aligns with their personal interests. This assignment reinforces the concepts learned in the lesson by applying them to a real-world example chosen by the student. The task involves three main components: first, identifying the different types of nodes within the chosen tree (root, internal, and leaf nodes); second, describing the population or dataset to which the decision tree applies; and third, explaining what the decision tree is predicting, which means defining the classifications found at the leaf nodes. This practical application helps solidify understanding of decision tree structure and purpose."
