    "title": "Lesson Procedure: Round 5 - Statistical Questions and Evaluation (Unit 4 Lesson 4)",
    "body": "Unit 4 Lesson 4 progresses to Round 5, where teams generate up to three statistical questions that their campaign data can help answer. These questions should be interesting and relevant to the campaign's topic, also accounting for the collected data on date, time, and place. The lesson emphasizes confirming that these questions are indeed statistical and answerable with the proposed data. Teachers circulate to verify this. Finally, teams evaluate the overall reasonableness and ethical soundness of their campaign, considering data variability, campaign manageability, trigger frequency, privacy concerns, and sufficiency of data for answering statistical questions. Adjustments are made if necessary."

  {
    "title": "Evaluating Campaign Reasonableness and Ethics (Unit 4 Lesson 4)",
    "body": "A critical part of Unit 4 Lesson 4 involves evaluating the reasonableness and ethical implications of the designed Participatory Sensing campaign. Teams discuss whether survey answers are likely to vary, if the campaign is executable, and if trigger frequency is optimal (not too rare, not too frequent). Crucially, they consider privacy and potential embarrassment from sharing data. They assess if changes to triggers or questions can improve the campaign and if enough relevant data can be gathered to answer their statistical questions. This evaluation ensures the campaign is practical and respects ethical considerations."
