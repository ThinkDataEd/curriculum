##***<u>Lesson 4: Predictions, Predictions</u>***

###**Objective:**
Students will continue to read articles critically. They will anticipate visualizations about the data that will
be collected from the class experiment and make predictions about the outcome.

###**Materials:**
1. Article: PsyBlog’s *Time Perception: How Your Brain Experiences Time* found at:<br>
    [https://www.spring.org.uk/2025/01/time-perception-brain.php](https://www.spring.org.uk/2025/01/time-perception-brain.php "https://www.spring.org.uk/2025/01/time-perception-brain.php"){:target="_blank"}

2. *Experiment Predictions* handout ([LMR_U3_L4](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 3_v_6.0/LMR_U3_L4.pdf))

###**Vocabulary:**
[theory](../../vocabulary/unit3/#theory "an idea used to explain a situation"){ .md-button }

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    Designing an experiment requires making many decisions, including what to
    measure and how to measure it.

###**Lesson:**
1. Students will read the article *Time Perception: How Your Brain Experiences Time* found at:<br>
    [https://www.spring.org.uk/2025/01/time-perception-brain.php](https://www.spring.org.uk/2025/01/time-perception-brain.php "https://www.spring.org.uk/2025/01/time-perception-brain.php"){:target="_blank"}

2. They will read the article critically to answer the following questions (displayed or written on the
board):

    100. Who was observed and what were the variables measured? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: People and their perception of time.***</span>

    100. What statistical questions were the researchers trying to answer? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: How is time
    perception affected by different stimuli or factors?***</span>
    
    100. Who collected the data? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Researchers collected the data.***</span>

    100. How were the data collected? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Case studies, behavioural experiments, and advanced imaging technologies are mentioned as methods of data collection.***</span>

    100. What claim(s) did the article make? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: The article claimed that there are multiple factors involved in time perception such as psychological factors, physiological factors, and environmental factors.***</span>

    100. What statistics could be found by the ideas presented in this article? <span style="color:grey">***Answers may vary.
    A possible answer might be to ask for the statistic of people who report a change in time perception as they got older.***</span>    

3. In their teams, ask students to share their responses from reading the *Time Perception: How Your Brain Experiences Time* article and agree on the responses as a team.

4. Do a quick *Whip Around* of the responses (see step #2 for possible responses).

5. Remind students that they designed a class experiment during the previous lesson but did not
select an actual treatment. As a class, decide on a treatment to use for the experiment. Students
can use the methods found in the article for inspiration, or come up with something novel on their
own.

    **<u>Note:</u>** Stimuli examples include music (genres determined by the class), lights off, physical
    activity (e.g., holding arms out), relaxation/meditation techniques, heads down, eyes closed, etc.
    Ensure that the experiment can be completed in **<u>one</u>** 50-60 minute class period. Treatments
    requiring excessive preparation time (e.g., running a mile) are less than ideal.

6. Before they conduct the experiment, students will test their theories by making predictions about
the data and the outcomes. A **theory** is an idea used to explain a situation.

7. Display the class experiment’s research question:

    **How does our perception of time change when exposed to a stimulus?**

8. Take a poll of the students who believe that there will be differences in the estimate of the length
of a minute between the treatment and control groups. The remaining students, then, do not
believe that there will be differences.

9. Then, ask those students who believe there are differences, how small or large they think the
difference will be.

10. Distribute the *Experiment Predictions* handout ([LMR_U3_L4](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 3_v_6.0/LMR_U3_L4.pdf)) and, in pairs, have students discuss
and complete the answers for the handout.

    **<u>Note:</u>** What will the distribution of time perceptions look like? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: The distributions will likely have
    more points that are closer to 60 seconds, but will also have values that are shorter and
    longer than 60 seconds. Appropriate plots to use will include histograms, dotplots or
    boxplots.***</span>

11. Using *Anonymous Author*, select student work to share with the whole class.

12. Give student teams time (about 2 minutes) to discuss each product that is shared/presented.

13. Teams will offer their thoughts using a modified *Two Cents* strategy where, instead of two cents,
each team will receive one cent (or a token) and, in order to turn it in, the team will have to make
comments or ask questions about the student work that is being shared. Call on teams until you
have collected every cent. This ensures that all teams contribute to the discussion.

14. Inform students that they will conduct the experiment in which they will estimate the length of time
of one minute during the [next lesson](lesson5.md).

###**Class Scribes:**
One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the
day were.
