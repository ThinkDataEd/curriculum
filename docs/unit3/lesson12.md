##***<u>Lesson 12: Bias in Survey Sampling</u>***

###**Objective:**
Students will learn about bias in relation to survey sampling. More specifically, they will learn what types
of sampling methods could result in a biased sample, who might be over/under-represented in the sample,
and how to select a better sample.

###**Materials:**
1. *Identifying Biased Samples* handout ([LMR_U3_L12_A](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 3_v_6.0/LMR_U3_L12_A.pdf))

2. Poster paper

3. *Survey Sampling* handout ([LMR_U3_L12_B](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 3_v_6.0/LMR_U3_L12_B.pdf))

###**Vocabulary:**
[survey sample](../../vocabulary/unit3/#survey-sample "people who are asked to participate in a survey"){ .md-button }
[over-represented](../../vocabulary/unit3/#over-represented "represented excessively especially; having representatives in a proportion higher than the average"){ .md-button }
[under-represented](../../vocabulary/unit3/#under-represented "a subset of a population that holds a smaller percentage within a significant subgroup than the subset holds in the general population"){ .md-button }

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    Bias concerning survey sampling includes identifying sampling methods that may lead to biased samples, recognizing potential over- or under-representation in samples, and acquiring skills to choose more reliable sampling techniques.

###**Lesson:**
1. Remind students that they learned about biased samples during the last few lessons. Today, they
will continue with this topic and discuss how people are selected to be in a sample.

2. The people who are asked to participate in a survey are known as the **survey sample**. Ideally,
the people who are included in the survey sample are a representative group of the target
population, or the population we would like to make inferences about.

3. Propose the following scenario to the class: “An elementary school is going to start serving ice
cream in the cafeteria every Friday during lunch, and needs to know the favorite flavor of its
students."

4. In pairs, ask students to come up with two examples of samples that might be biased. For instance,
one biased sample might include only the four 3<sup>rd</sup> grade classes at the school. For each biased
sample, the students should answer the following questions in their DS journals:

    100. Who is the target population? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: All students at the elementary school.***</span>

    100. Who is included in your biased sample? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Only 3<sup>rd</sup> grade students. These students are
    ***</span> **over-represented**
     <span style="color:grey">*** in the sample.***</span>

    100. Who is not included in your biased sample?  <span style="color:grey">***Answer: All other students in the school
    (Kindergartners, 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, and 5<sup>th</sup> graders). These students are***</span> **under-represented**
     <span style="color:grey">***in the sample.***</span>

    100. Is your sample representative of the target population? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: No! We’re only including 3<sup>rd</sup>
    graders, and they may not have the same preferences as other students.***</span>

5. Once pairs have come up with their biased samples and answered the questions in step 4 above, they
should share out with their student teams and answer the following questions:

    100. How is your biased sample different from the samples created by other pairs in your
    team? <span style="color:grey">***Answers will vary by class. An example might be that one pair sampled only
    3<sup>rd</sup> graders and the other pair sampled only girls.***</span>

    100. Which do you think is more representative of the target population? Why? <span style="color:grey">***Answers will
    vary by class. Using the example above, we could argue that either one is more
    representative. We could maybe say that, since 3<sup>rd</sup> graders include both boys and
    girls, we have a more representative sample than if we just sampled girls. Or, we
    could say that since girls come from all grade levels, they’re more representative
    of the entire school than just 3<sup>rd</sup> graders.***</span>

6. After the teams have discussed their samples, they should select one pair’s biased sample to
share with the rest of the class. Record each team’s biased sample on a sheet of poster paper
with the following layout:

    | **Biased Sample** | **Who is overrepresented?** | **Who is underrepresented?** |
    |------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | <span style="color:grey">***All 3<sup>rd</sup> grade students***</span> | <span style="color:grey">***3<sup>rd</sup> grade students***</span> | <span style="color:grey">***All other students (kindergartners, 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, and 5<sup>th</sup> graders)***</span> |

7. Distribute the *Identifying Biased Samples* handout ([LMR_U3_L12_A](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 3_v_6.0/LMR_U3_L12_A.pdf)). In this activity, students will
explain why a particular sampling method might result in a biased sample – a sample that is not
representative of the population of interest.

    **<u>Note:</u>** It is NOT enough for students to say that the “sample is not random.” They need to explain
    how the sample is biased.

    **<u>Note:</u>** Page 2 of the handout provides sample answers for teacher reference. Do NOT
    distribute page 2 to students.

8. Each student should complete the handout independently. Afterwards, conduct a whole-class
discussion to compare and contrast different students’ explanations of how the samples might be
biased. For each example given in the handout, discuss who is most likely over-represented and
who is most likely under-represented in the sample.

9. Ask the students:

    100. Now that we have learned about sampling biases, how can we eliminate this type of
    bias? <span style="color:grey">***Answers will vary by class.***</span>

    **<u>Note:</u>** Allow students to collaborate and come up with a few ideas on their own of how to
    eliminate sampling bias. If desired, ideas can be written on the board for discussion and
    comparison.

10. Conclude with the actual answer: **random sampling**.

    100. If we randomly sample people from our population of interest, we can reduce the bias of
    any sample statistics obtained from the survey responses.

    100. If we have a biased sample, we can only give descriptions about that particular sample;
    we CANNOT generalize to the population of interest.

###**Class Scribes:**
One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the
day were.
