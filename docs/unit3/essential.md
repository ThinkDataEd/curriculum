##**IDS Unit 3: Essential Concepts**

###**<u>[Lesson 1: Anecdotes vs. Data](lesson1.md)</u>**
Data beat anecdotes. In science, we need to closely examine the quality of evidence in order to make
sound conclusions. Anecdotes can contain personal bias, might be carefully selected to represent a
particular point of view, and, in general, may be completely different from the general trend.

###**<u>[Lesson 2: What is an Experiment?](lesson2.md)</u>**
Science is often concerned with the question "What causes things to happen?". To answer this, controlled
experiments are required. Controlled experiments have several key features: (1) there is a treatment
variable and a response variable, and we wish to see if the treatment causes a change that we can
measure with the response variable; (2) There is a comparison/control group; (3) Subjects are assigned
randomly to treatment or control (randomized assignment); (4) Subjects are not aware of which group
they are in (a 'blind'). This may require the use of a placebo for those in the control group; and (5) those
who measure the response variable do not know which group the subjects were in (if both 4 and 5 are
satisfied, this is a 'double blind' experiment).

###**<u>[Lesson 3: Let’s Try an Experiment!](lesson3.md)</u>**
Randomized assignment is required to determine cause-and-effect.

###**<u>[Lesson 4: Predictions, Predictions](lesson4.md)</u>**
Designing an experiment requires making many decisions, including what to measure and how to
measure it.

###**<u>[Lesson 5: Time Perception Experiment](lesson5.md)</u>**
Designing and carrying out an experiment helps us answer specific statistical questions of interest.

###**<u>[Lesson 6: Observational Studies](lesson6.md)</u>**
Observational studies are those for which there is no intervention applied by researchers.

###**<u>[Lesson 7: Observational Studies vs. Experiments](lesson7.md)</u>**
Experiments are not always possible because of various factors such as ethics, cost limitations, and
feasibility.

###**<u>[Lesson 8: Monsters that Hide in Observational Studies](lesson8.md)</u>**
Confounding factors/variables make it difficult to determine a cause-and-effect relationship between two
variables.

###**<u>[Lesson 9: Survey Says…](lesson9.md)</u>**
Surveys ask simple, straightforward questions in order to collect data that can be used to answer
statistical questions. Writing such questions can be hard (but fun)!

###**<u>[Lesson 10: We’re So Random](lesson10.md)</u>**
Another popular data collection method involves collecting data from a random sample of people or
objects. Percentages based on random samples tend to "center" on the population parameter value.

###**<u>[Lesson 11: The Gettysburg Address](lesson11.md)</u>**
Statistics vary from sample to sample. If the typical value across many samples is equal to the population
parameter, the statistic is "unbiased". Bias means that we tend to “miss the mark.” If we don't do random
sampling, we can get biased estimates.

###**<u>[Lesson 12: Bias in Survey Sampling](lesson12.md)</u>**
Bias concerning survey sampling includes identifying sampling methods that may lead to biased samples, recognizing potential over- or under-representation in samples, and acquiring skills to choose more reliable sampling techniques.

###**<u>[Lesson 13: The Confidence Game](lesson13.md)</u>**
There is uncertainty when we estimate population parameters. Because of this, it is better to give a range of plausible values, rather than a single value.

###**<u>[Lesson 14: How Confident Are You?](lesson14.md)</u>**
The margin of error expresses our uncertainty in an estimate. The estimate, plus or minus the margin of error, gives us an interval in which we are very confident the true value lies.

###**<u>[Lesson 15 Ready, Sense, Go!](lesson15.md)</u>**
Sensors are another data collection method. Unlike what we have seen so far, sensors do not involve
humans (much). They collect data according to an algorithm.

###**<u>[Lesson 16: Does it have a Trigger?](lesson16.md)</u>**
A key feature that distinguishes the way sensors collect data from more traditional approaches is that
sensors collect data when a 'trigger' event occurs. In Participatory Sensing, this event is something we
humans agree upon beforehand. Every time that trigger happens, we collect data.

###**<u>[Lesson 17: Creating Our Own Participatory Sensing Campaign](lesson17.md)</u>**
Creating a Participatory Sensing Campaign requires that survey questions must be completed whenever
they are “triggered”. Research questions provide an overall direction in a Participatory Sensing Campaign.

###**<u>[Lesson 18: Evaluating Our Own Participatory Sensing Campaign](lesson18.md)</u>**
Statistical questions guide a Participatory Sensing Campaign so that we can learn about a community or
ourselves. These campaigns should be evaluated before implementing to make sure they are reasonable
and ethically sound.

###**<u>[Lesson 19: Implementing Our Own Participatory Sensing Campaign](lesson19.md)</u>**
Practicing data collection prior to implementation allows optimization of a Participatory Sensing Campaign.

###**<u>[Lesson 20: Online Data-ing](lesson20.md)</u>**
We stretch students' conception of data, to help them see that many web pages present information that can be turned into data.

###**<u>[Lesson 21: Learning to Love XML](lesson21.md)</u>**
XML is a programming language that we use with our campaigns. We create basic XML "tags" in the
code, which help us store data in a format we understand.

###**<u>[Lesson 22: Changing Format](lesson22.md)</u>**
Converting XML to spreadsheet format helps us better understand and view our data.
