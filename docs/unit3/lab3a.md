##***<u>Lab 3A - The results are in!</u>***

Directions: Follow along with the slides, completing the questions in <span style="color:midnightblue;">**blue**</span> on your computer, and answering the questions in <span style="color:firebrick;">**red**</span> in your journal.

###**Conducting experiments**
* Previously in class, you conducted an experiment to gauge how a stimulus affected people's
perception of time.

    – Some people were given a treatment, others were not.

* In this lab, we'll use the data cycle to analyze the *research question*:

    *Does the stimulus your class chose change people's perception of time?*

###**Coming up with questions**
* <span style="color:firebrick;">**(1) Write down two statistical investigative questions that will help you answer the *research question*
from the previous slide.**</span>

* <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Then, *export*, *upload*, *import* your experiment data into RStudio.**</span>

    – If you're having trouble coming up with good statistical investigative questions, try loading the
    data and looking at the variables.

    – Ask yourself, *How would I use these variables to answer the research question?*

###**Analyzing our data**
* <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Create appropriate plots to answer your statistical investigative questions.**</span>

* <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Calculate appropriate numerical summaries to answer your statistical investigative questions.**</span>

* <span style="color:firebrick;">**(2) Write down a few sentences interpreting your plots and summaries.**</span>

###**Wrapping it up**
* Is it possible your initial results occurred by chance alone?

    – <span style="color:firebrick;">**(3) Write and run code using repeated shuffling to determine how likely the typical difference between
    the two groups occurred by chance alone.**</span>

    – <span style="color:firebrick;">**(4) Create a plot and use it to justify your answer.**</span>

* What do you conclude about the *research question*?

    – <span style="color:firebrick;">**(5) Write a report using the plots and analysis you conducted to answer the
    *research question*.**</span>

    – Be sure to describe how you conducted your experiment.
