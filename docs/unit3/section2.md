An observational study is a data collection method in which subjects are observed and outcomes are
recorded. Unlike experiments, it may not be possible to assign subjects to treatment and control groups in
observational studies, which impedes our ability to control for confounding factors. This means that
researchers must rely on existing control and treatment groups to observe the outcomes. Observational
studies can show associations in the data, but cause and effect relationships can only be concluded with
experiments.

##<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Engagement**</p>
Students will participate in the *Observational Studies Activity* described in [Lesson 5](lesson5.md). They will record
information that can be obtained through pictures. The data will then be analyzed to see if there are any
variables related to the number of friends a person has on social media.

<ins>*Statistical/Mathematical:*</ins>

S-IC 1. Understand statistics as a process for making inferences about population parameters based on a random sample from that population.

S-IC 3. Recognize the purposes of and differences among sample surveys, experiments, and
observational studies; explain how randomization relates to each.

S-IC 6: Evaluate reports based on data.

<ins>*Data Science:*</ins>

Understand that data from observational studies can help us find associations among variables. Explain
why some variables that are not related in reality might look as though they are due to the presence of
confounding factors.

<ins>*Applied Computational Thinking using RStudio:*</ins>

• Download data from the Internet that was collected via an observational study.

• Clean dataset by adding variable names.

• Create scatterplots of two variables and determine possible relationships between them, as well
as identify potential confounding variables.

<ins>*Real-World Connections:*</ins>

Economists, psychologists, and biologists conduct observational studies to study human behavior. For
example, observational studies are used in epidemiology to study outbreaks of illnesses and people’s
behavioral patterns.

##<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Language Objectives**</p>
1. Students will use connect the data they gather through Participatory Sensing campaigns to observational studies.

2. Students will compare and contrast observational studies with experiments.

3. Students will describe the relationship between causation and association.

given in a picture.
