##***<u>Practicum: What Does Our Campaign Data Say?</u>***

###**Objective:**
Students will answer one of the statistical investigative questions they generated at the beginning of the Participatory Sensing
campaign creation lesson. They will use RStudio to make graphical representations or numerical
summaries of their data to answer their question.

###**Materials:**
1. *Our Own Campaign* ([LMR_U3_Practicum_Our_Own_Campaign](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 3_v_6.0/LMR_U3_Practicum_Our_Own_Campaign.pdf))

At the start of the Participatory Sensing campaign creation in [lesson 16](lesson16.md), the class developed a research question about your class’s topic of interest.

It is now time to analyze and interpret your class campaign data. You will use the data from your class-created
campaign only. Based on the analysis, you can also wonder about what other data would be
necessary to better answer your question, if any.

Based on the class’s campaign data collected:

1. Refer back to the statistical investigative questions your class generated in [lesson 16](lesson16.md)-[18](lesson18.md) that address the
research question.

2. Choose one of these statistical investigative questions and determine which variables will answer this question.

3. Analyze the data to answer the question you've chosen. Your analysis should include graphs
and numerical summaries. You should:

    a. Provide the plot and numerical summary.

    b. Describe what the plot shows.

    c. Explain why you chose to make that particular plot.

    d. Explain how the plot and numerical summary answers your statistical investigative question.

    e. Include the code you used in RStudio to make your plot.

4. After analyzing your data, determine if additional data would better answer your statistical investigative question. If so, propose what that data would be. Different variables? Different data collection approach? Same variables, but more people? Same variables and people but more time?

5. Now, choose two more statistical investigative questions that address the research question.

6. Analyze and interpret the data to answer these questions.

7. Sometimes, when analyzing data, we think of new statistical investigative questions to ask, or we realize that
the data need to be cleaned before we can answer. Explain whether this is the case with any of
your statistical investigative questions.

8. Write a one-page report and present it to another member of the class who is not in your team.
