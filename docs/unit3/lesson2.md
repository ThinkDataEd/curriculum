##***<u>Lesson 2: What is an Experiment?</u>***

###**Objective:**
Students will learn about the elements of an experiment and the meaning of "causation". Students will
learn to distinguish claims of causation from claims of association.

###**Materials:**

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    Science is often concerned with the question "What causes things to happen?". To
    answer this, controlled experiments are required. Controlled experiments have several key features: (1)
    there is a treatment variable and a response variable, and we wish to see if the treatment causes a
    change that we can measure with the response variable; (2) There is a comparison/control group; (3)
    Subjects are assigned randomly to treatment or control (randomized assignment); (4) Subjects are not
    aware of which group they are in (a 'blind'). This may require the use of a placebo for those in the control
    group; and (5) those who measure the response variable do not know which group the subjects were in (if
    both 4 and 5 are satisfied, this is a 'double blind' experiment).

###**Lesson:**
1. Display the following headlines to students:

    100. Stop Global Warming: Become a Pirate

    100. Lack of sleep may shrink your brain

    100. Early language skills reduce preschool tantrums

    100. Dogs walked by men are more aggressive

2. Discuss each headline by asking the following questions:

    100. What is the headline implying with its wording? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: 1a is implying that you can stop global
    warming by becoming a pirate, 1b is implying that it’s possible to shrink your brain
    if you aren’t getting enough sleep, 1c is implying that having early language skills
    will decrease preschool tantrums, 1d is implying that dogs are more aggressive
    when they’ve been walked by men.***</span>

    100. Is it implying causation or association? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Discuss definitions of causation and
    association. Causation means there is a cause and effect relationship between
    variables. For example, heat causes water to boil; whereas association or
    correlation means that high values of one variable tend to be associated with high
    values of the other (or high values tend to be with low values). However, this is not
    necessarily cause-and-effect at play. For example, blanket sales in Canada are
    associated with brush fires in Australia - not because Canadian blankets cause the
    fires, but because Canadian winters cause blanket sales, and Canadian winters are
    Australian summers, which cause fires. 1a, 1c and 1d are implying causation and
    1b is implying association.***</span>
    
    100. How can you tell the difference between causation and correlation? What words stand
    out in these headlines? <span style="color:grey">***Answers will vary but some terms for causation include:
    cause, increase/ decrease, benefits, impacts, effect/ affect, etc.; and for correlation
    include: get, have, linked, more/ less, tied, connected, etc. In 1a, “become” stands
    out; in 1b, “may” stands out; in 1c, “reduce” stands out; in 1d, “are” stands out.***</span>
    
    100. Change each causal version of a headline into a non-causal version and vice versa.
    <span style="color:grey">***Answers will vary but an example for 1a is to instead say Global Warming linked to
    increase of pirates.***</span>

3. Introduce the MythBusters video clip by answering the following questions, in teams, for their
headline “Are Hands-Free Calls Really Safer While Driving?”

    100. What is the headline implying with its wording? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: That hands-free calls might not be safer than holding a phone while driving.***</span>

    100. Is it implying causation or correlation? How do you know? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Causation because
    “really safer” implies that driving while on a hands-free call causes you to not drive safely.***</span>

    100. How can we determine if this is true? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Split the class into groups and have each team
    come up with a way to determine if this is true. Each group should assume that
    they get to examine 30 people.***</span>

4. Show the MythBusters video clip called *Are Hands-Free Calls Really Safer While Driving?* The clip can be found at: <br> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-RAKWdKDEk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-RAKWdKDEk "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-RAKWdKDEk"){:target="_blank"}

5. Focus students on the following guiding questions and ask them to take notes as they watch the video clip:

    100. How did the MythBusters design the investigation? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: They conducted a driving test. In this case, one group is driving while on a hands-free call (because in the eyes of the law, this is no different than driving without being on a call). The treatment group is driving while on a hands-free call. They determined that "safe" meant passing the driving course by following the turn-by-turn navigation correctly and having no accidents. Passing the driving course was considered a "success".***</span>

    100. What steps did they take? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: They split the 30 subjects into two groups, 15 in one group and 15 in the treatment group, and had them drive a car in a simulator.***</span>

    100. How is this different than your team’s headline responses in step 3 from above? Did the Mythbusters investigation match what you thought it would be about? <span style="color:grey">***Answers will vary depending on students' assumptions about the investigation prior to watching the video.***</span>

6. After viewing the clip, inform students that the MythBusters have just conducted an **experiment**,
which is one method of data collection.

7. We begin with a brief introduction into “what is an experiment” but the definition will be developed
over the next several lessons.

8. Guide students to identify the elements of an experiment by referring back to the video clip:
    100. **Research Question** — the question to be answered by the experiment <br><span style="color:grey">***Are Hands-Free Calls Really Safer While Driving?***</span>

    100. **Subjects** – people or objects that are participating in the experiment <br><span style="color:grey">***The 30 adults.***</span>

    100. **Treatment** – the variable that is deliberately manipulated to investigate its influence on the outcome; this is sometimes known as the explanatory, or independent, variable <br><span style="color:grey">***Having drivers on a call without a cellphone in their hand. Using the research question as our guide, the question implies that we are experimenting with the hands-free calling, therefore that is the treatment as we are comparing it to hands-on calling.***</span>

    100. **Treatment group** – the group of subjects that receive the treatment <br><span style="color:grey">***The 15 people who used the hands-free phone.***</span>

    100. **Control group** – the group that does not receive a treatment <br><span style="color:grey">***The remaining 15 people who used the hands-on phone.***</span>

    100. **Random assignment** – subjects are randomly assigned to either the treatment or control
    group <br><span style="color:grey">***It's unclear if random assignment was used in this video (if it was, we were not told so), but we're going to assume that people were randomly assigned to each group.***</span>
    
    100. **Outcome** – the variable that the treatment is meant to influence; this is sometimes known as the response, or dependent, variable <br><span style="color:grey">***Success - whether or not a person was a safe driver by passing the test.***</span>
    
    100. **Statistic** — a number such as a mean or proportion used to summarize our findings for the control and treatment groups <br> <span style="color:grey">***In this case, the MythBusters gave raw data. A statistic would have been that 6.7% (1 out of 15) of the control group passed the test. Similarly, 6.7% of the treatment group passed the test.***</span>
    
    **<u>Note:</u>** In this experiment, and in those found in the IDS curriculum, we use a treatment and a
    control group. However, a control group is not a necessary element of an experiment. Sometimes
    it is more appropriate to have two treatment groups with no control group (e.g., medical
    professionals testing different doses of drugs). The effect that is being studied will dictate whether
    to feature a control group or not.

9. Display the following questions on the board or projector. Using *T-I-P-S*, ask students to discuss
them.

    100. Why did the MythBusters follow all of these steps to design their experiment? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: In order to determine if driving while on a hands-free call was really safer than driving while holding a cellphone on a call.***</span>

    100. We don't know how MythBusters chose who would be in the treatment group and who
    would be in the other group. Suppose that less-experienced drivers were assigned to one group and the more-experienced drivers ended up in the treatment group. Would you believe the conclusions? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: No, because less-experienced drivers would probably be more prone to mistakes (because they're inexperienced) than more-experienced drivers. Explain that this --another explanation for the cause-and-effect--
    is called a confounding variable.***</span>
    
    100. Explain that in order to make the two groups as similar as possible, experimenters
    usually assign subjects randomly. How might we randomly assign about half of the
    subjects to the treatment and half to the control? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: We might flip a coin, and those who
    get Heads go to Treatment.***</span>
    
    100. Why would random assignment improve the MythBusters experiment? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Because then the two
    groups would be more similar, so we wouldn't have a confounding variable to
    worry about.***</span>

10. **Emphasize that without random assignment, we cannot determine causation because we
are not comparing two similar groups.**

###**Class Scribes:**
One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the
day were.
