unit design project.

###**Materials:**
1. *End of Unit 2 Project: Comparing Groups Using Our Own Data* ([LMR_U2_End_of_Unit_Project](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_6.0/LMR_U2_End_of_Unit_Project.pdf))

Available datasets:

1. Food Habits

2. Time Use

3. Stress/Chill

4. Personality Color

Your mission is to ask and answer a statistical investigative question using at least one dataset above.

1. Your question must include a comparison of two distinct groups.

2. Your analysis should address whether any observed differences are real or could be simply due
to chance.

3. You should use at least two of the following methods to answer your question with appropriate
explanations:

    * ❏ Merge data

    * ❏ Create simulations

    * ❏ Calculate probabilities based on simulations

    * ❏ Use a Normal model

    * ❏ Shuffle/permute data

You will have 5 days to complete this project with your assigned partner. You need to:

* ❏ Prepare an presentation (both partners need to participate) that includes:

    * o A 4-slide, 5-minute presentation.

    * o An explanation of why you think your statistical investigative question is interesting.

    * o An interpretation of supporting plots and summaries that answer your question.

    * o A reasoning of whether you think the outcome might be due to chance.

* ❏ Submit a 2-4 page typed, double-spaced summary of your analysis.

*<u>Project Assignment Sequence:</u>*

* ❏ Day 1: Decide on a statistical investigative question with assigned partner.

    * ❏ Get approval from teacher.

* ❏ Day 2: Working day for analysis – create plots and numerical summaries.

* ❏ Day 3: Working day for analysis – create presentation (4 slides maximum).

* ❏ Day 4: Presentations.

* ❏ Day 5: Presentations.
