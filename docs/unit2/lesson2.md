##**<u>Lesson 2: What Does Mean Mean?</u>**

###**Objective:**
Students will learn that values that gather around the center of a distribution show the typical value. This
value is also referred to as the mean, or average.

###**Materials:**
1. *Pennies on a Ruler* handout ([LMR_U2_L2_A](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_6.0/LMR_U2_L2_A.pdf))

    **Digitial Option:** IDS Balancing Point app

    *Balancing Point* handout ([LMR_U2_L2_B](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_6.0/LMR_U2_L2_B.pdf))

2. Markers (1 for each table)

3. Rulers (1 for each table)

4. Pennies (6 for each table group)

5. Tape

6. Exported, printed, and reproduced class’s *Personality Color* survey data

    **<u>Advance preparation required:</u>** The teacher must share students’ data on the IDS Home page
    ([https://portal.thinkdataed.org](https://portal.thinkdataed.org "https://portal.thinkdataed.org"){:target="_blank"}) before it can be exported and printed. Students will keep for use in
    subsequent lessons (see step 9 of lesson).

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    The center of a distribution is the 'typical' value. One way of measuring the center is
    with the mean, which finds the balancing point of the distribution. The mean gives us the typical value, but
    does not tell the whole story. We need a way to measure the variability to understand how observations
    might differ from the typical value.

###**Lesson:**
1. In student pairs, ask students to discuss what they think the following terms mean:

    100. Measures of central tendency. <span style="color:grey">***Answer: A value that shows the tendency of quantitative data
    to gather around a central, or***</span> ***typical***<span style="color:grey">***, value. Also known as measures of ***</span> ***center***<span style="color:grey">***.
    Students will learn about two such measures: the mean and the median.***</span>
    
    100. Measures of variability. <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Values that show how much the quantitative data varies.
    Also known as measures of***</span> ***spread***. 
    
    **<u>Note:</u>** Measures of variability are not taught during this lesson, but
    will be addressed as part of [Lesson 4](lesson4.md).

2. Ask a pair to share what they think these two terms mean. Pairs who are listening must decide
whether they agree or disagree with the pair that shared. Lead a discussion based on their
statements of agreement or disagreement.

3. Communicate to the class that they will be learning more about these measures and what they
tell us about data as we progress through this unit.

4. By a show of hands, ask students how many are familiar with finding the **mean**, or **average**.

5. Select a student to share his/her process for finding the mean. <span style="color:grey">***Possible answer: Add up all of
the numbers. Then divide by how many numbers there are.***</span>

6. Another way to find the mean is to find the **balancing point** of a distribution. They will learn about
the balancing point via the activity in steps 7 and 8 below.

7. Distribute the *Pennies on a Ruler* handout ([LMR_U2_L2_A](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_6.0/LMR_U2_L2_A.pdf)) along with a marker, ruler, tape, and 6
pennies to each table group. If you prefer to not print the document, you can project it on the
board instead.

    **<u>Note:</u>** Alternatively, you can substitute the digital version of this activity using the *Balancing Point* handout ([LMR_U2_L2_B](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_6.0/LMR_U2_L2_B.pdf)).

8. Guide the students through the handout and have them share their findings throughout the
activity. Be sure to emphasize the idea that <u>the mean of a distribution can be identified by finding
its balancing point.</u>

9. Next, distribute the class’s *Personality Color* survey data to the students.

10. Have student pairs find the variable <span style="color:blue">***Blue***</span> (whether or not that was their predominant color) in the
class’s printed data.

11. As a class, make a dot plot on the board to show the distribution of <span style="color:blue">***Blue***</span> values. Each student
should come to the board and draw a dot to indicate where their value is in the distribution. Ask
the students:

    100. What do you think the typical <span style="color:blue">***Blue***</span> score is? <span style="color:grey">***Answers will vary by class. They should
    be driven to an answer in the center of the distribution.***</span>

    100. Are the data roughly symmetric? Where is the balancing point of this distribution?
    <span style="color:grey">***Answers will vary by class. Once a value is chosen, indicate the location on the dot
    plots.***</span>

12. As a class, compute the mean <span style="color:blue">***Blue***</span> score for the entire class on the board and compare this
value to the class’s prediction of the balancing point. Students may not remember exactly how to
compute the mean, so you can remind them of the general algorithm or refer them back to their
responses from Step 5 above.

13. Show the students the formula for calculating the mean:
<center><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bar{x}=\frac{&space;\sum_{i=1}^{n}&space;x_i}{n}" title="\bar{x}=\frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}" /></center>

14. Now that they have calculated the mean for the <span style="color:blue">***Blue***</span> score, ask them to identify each symbol in
the formula with a step in their algorithm for finding the mean, and discuss the meaning of the
symbols in the formula as a class. <span style="color:grey">***Answer: x<sub>i</sub> represents each individual data point and n
represents the total number of observations.***</span>

15. Indicate the location of the calculated mean on the dot plots by drawing a vertical line at the value
on the x-axis. Ask student pairs to engage in a conversation about how close the mean value is to
their predicted balancing point and why their prediction was made that way. Select a pair to share
their discussion with the whole class.

16. Using the *Personality Color* survey data from Step 9 above, ask student pairs to compute the mean
score for each of the other three personality colors.

17. Inform the students that, during the [next lesson](lesson3.md), they will learn about another method that can be
used for measuring the center of a distribution.

18. Now, you can inform the class about an even easier method of calculating the mean – using
RStudio! Explain that the command RStudio uses to calculate the mean incorporates the
algorithm of summing up all the data and dividing by the total number of observations. Students
will be able to use this command for quick calculations now.

    **<u>Note:</u>** If you have already “*Exported*, *Uploaded*, *Imported*” the class’s Personality
    Color campaign data, you can simply use the exact command below to calculate the
    mean <span style="color:blue">***Blue***</span> score:

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**> mean(~blue, data = colors)**

    In general, the function can be denoted as follows:

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**> mean(~variable, data = datafile)**

    So, for our specific example, ```blue``` is the ```variable``` we want to find the mean value of,
    and ```colors``` is the ```datafile```.

19. Have the students *Think-Pair-Share* to discuss how the mean value of a group of data could be
used to easily describe complicated things. For example, instead of giving someone the entire
class’s <span style="color:blue">***Blue***</span> scores, we could just tell him/her the mean score and he/she would have a general
idea about the class.

###**Class Scribes:**
One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the
day were.

###<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Homework**</p>
Students should complete the *Mr. Jones Mile Run Times* handout ([LMR_U2_L2_C](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_6.0/LMR_U2_L2_C.pdf)) for homework. They
can practice finding the mean of distributions by determining a balancing point for the data. Answers
to the handout are below. <br> **<u>Note:</u>** The mean values in part (3) do NOT need to be exact.
