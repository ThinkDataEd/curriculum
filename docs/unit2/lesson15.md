###**Objective:**
Students will learn how to merge two data sets and ask statistical questions about the merged data.

###**Materials:**
1. *Tangible Data Merging* file ([LMR_2.14_Tangible Data Merging](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_6.0/LMR_2.14_Tangible Data Merging.pdf))

    **Advanced preparation required** (see Step 4 of lesson)

2. Copy paper in two colors

    **Advanced preparation required** (see Step 4 of lesson)

###**Vocabulary:**
merge

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    We can enhance the context of a statistical problem by merging related data sets
    together. To merge data, each data set must have a "unique identifier" that tells us how to match up the
    lines of the data.

###**Lesson:**
1. Inform students that they are going to examine the research question "Does the personality color
test really work?" To answer this, we're going to examine whether the different color groups
actually differ on particular beliefs or attitudes, or if these differences might just be due to chance.
In particular, we are going to use the *Stress/Chill* data to see if there is evidence that the "colors"
actually differ.

2. Show students the variables in each of these data sets. Give students time to brainstorm
statistical questions of interest with their teams and record their questions in their DS journals.
Encourage them to think of two- and three-variable questions.

3. Conduct a share out of some of the questions students came up with. Examples include: <span style="color:grey">***(1) Do
people whose predominant color is Gold tend to stress more than people whose
predominant color is Blue? (2) Is there a difference between the sorts of things that stress
out the different personality colors?***</span>

4. In order to answer the above questions, we will need to merge our class’s 2 data sets together
(*Personality Color* and *Stress/Chill*). In order to do this, we will be practicing how to merge data
sets today.

5. Print out the material from the *Tangible Data Merging* file ([LMR_2.14](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_6.0/LMR_2.14_Tangible Data Merging.pdf)). Use a different color of
paper for each of the two data sets. For example, Data set 1 could be on plain white paper and
Data set 2 could be on blue paper. Cut the paper by creating horizontal strips of each observation
of data. For example, from the screenshot below, of the first page of Data Set 1, you would create 12 different strips of paper, one
for each observation.
    <div align="right"><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https://curriculum.idsucla.org/IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_6.0/LMR_2.14_Tangible Data Merging.pdf&embedded=true" style=" width:420px;height:400px;" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>[LMR_2.14](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_6.0/LMR_2.14_Tangible Data Merging.pdf)</div>


6. Hand each student in the class a strip of paper. Ask them to try to find someone with the other
data set (i.e., a person with a different colored strip of paper) that they can “match up,” or **merge**,
with.

7. For example, a student with the first row of data listed below from Data set 1 might want to match
up with the second row of data listed below from Data set 2 because a person who is 21 has
probably graduated high school.

    |**Birth Month**| **Zip Code**| **Age**| **ID Number**| **Favorite Movie**|
    |--|--|--|--|--|
    |January| 90064| 21| 1742| The Notebook|

    |**Zip Code**| **ID Number**| **Birth Month**| **Siblings**| **Education**|
    |--|--|--|--|--|
    |91331| 1352| August| 2| High School|

8. However, they should notice that they cannot just make guesses about a person’s characteristics
in order to match up the data. They should realize that only 3 of the variables are the same in
both data sets: *Birth Month*, *Zip Code*, and *ID Number*.

    100. Since multiple people have the same *Birth Month*, discuss why this may not be the best
    variable to merge with. <span style="color:grey">***Multiple people are born in January, so we would have no
    way of differentiating between those people.***</span>

    100. The same is true for the *Zip Codes* variable. Although there are less repeats with *Zip
    Codes*, we still see some overlap between observations.

    100. So, the only *UNIQUE* identifier in both data sets is *ID Number*. So the students should
    end up in pairs at the end of the exercise – a student from Data set 1 is matched with the
    student from Data set 2 that has the same *ID Number*.

9. Have the students write about the experience of tangible data merging in their DS journals and
ask:

    100. Why is it important to have at least one unique identifier for both data sets? <span style="color:grey">***It is the only
    way to know which information belongs to which person. We want to make sure we
    do not match up observations (in this case, people) incorrectly because that will
    compromise any analysis we do later.***</span>

10. Inform students that they will learn to merge data sets using RStudio during the next lab.

###**Class Scribes:**
One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the
day were.

###<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Homework & Next Day**</p>
Students will collect data for one more day for the *Stress/Chill* campaign either through the UCLA [IDS
UCLA](../download/app.md) App or via web browser at https://portal.idsucla.org
