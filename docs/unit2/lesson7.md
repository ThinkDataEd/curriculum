##**<u>Lesson 7: Plot Match</u>**

###**Objective:**
Students will learn how to create a boxplot from an already-established dotplot.

###**Materials:**
1. *From Dotplots to Boxplots* handout ([LMR_U2_L7_A](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_6.0/LMR_U2_L7_A.pdf))

2. Sets of plots from *Plot Match* file ([LMR_U2_L7_B](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_6.0/LMR_U2_L7_B.pdf)) – one for each team

    **<u>Advance preparation required:</u>** Needs to be cut out prior to class (see step 8 in lesson)

###**Vocabulary:**

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    Boxplots are an alternative visualization of histograms or dotplots. They capture
    most, but not all, of the features we can see in a dotplot or histogram.

###**Lesson:**
1. Ask students to complete an *Entrance Slip* by recalling the components of the five-number
summary that make up a boxplot. <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Five-number summary: minimum, 1<sup>st</sup> quartile (Q<sub>1</sub>), median,
3<sup>rd</sup> quartile (Q<sub>3</sub>), maximum.***</span>

2. Randomly select students to share the components and briefly discuss what each means in a
boxplot. If students are missing a component, ask them to add the component to their list.

3. Remind students that during [Lesson 5](lesson5.md), they created a boxplot from students’ heights.

4. Explain that a boxplot is one **representation** of the distribution of a variable in a data set. They
have worked with other representations of distributions. Ask students:
    
    100. What other representations of distributions have we seen? <span style="color:grey">***Answers may include:
    dotplots, bar charts, scatterplots, histograms, and tables.***</span>

5. Distribute the *From Dotplots to Boxplots* handout ([LMR_U2_L7_A](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_6.0/LMR_U2_L7_A.pdf)). In teams, students will sketch
boxplots from dotplots. They will need to determine the five-number summaries of each plot, and
should clearly label each value on their boxplots. <br> **<u>Note:</u>** Page 3 of the handout is an answer key for teacher reference only.

6. Students should answer the 3 questions included in the handout. They can discuss their answers
in pairs, and then have a class share out of the responses.

7. Once the discussion wraps up, inform the students that they will now attempt to find plots that
represent the same data but are plotted differently.

8. Distribute one set of plots, from the *Plot Match* file ([LMR_U2_L7_B](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_6.0/LMR_U2_L7_B.pdf)), to each student team.

    **<u>Advance preparation required:</u>** Each student team will receive a set of plots containing all 15
    plots from the *Plot Match* file ([LMR_U2_L7_B](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_6.0/LMR_U2_L7_B.pdf)). Copies will need to be cut and sorted prior to class
    time. To keep the plots together, you can either paper clip them or place them in zippered bags.

    **<u>Note:</u>** Do not distribute the handout for students to cut out the plots!

9. Inform students that they are now going to gather in their teams and practice matching different
representations of distributions. Each group will receive 15 plots (5 dotPlots, 5 histograms, and 5
boxplots). Their task is to determine which dotplots, histograms, and boxplots represent the same
data.

10. Once each group has decided upon their 5 groupings, engage the students in a class share out
until all students agree. Then, have the students record their responses to the following
statements and/or questions in their DS journals:

    100. What types of data are best for using a histogram? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Histograms are useful for almost
    any type of data. They can easily show the shape of a distribution (including
    skewness and multiple peaks). They are usually best with larger datasets.***</span>
    
    100. What types of data are best for using a dotplot? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Dotplots can also easily show the
    shape of a distribution. They are preferred over histograms when there is a
    relatively small amount of data.***</span>
    
    100. What types of data are best for using a boxplot? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Boxplots are useful when the
    distribution has one mode (one peak). They are also useful to describe data that
    are heavily skewed or that contain outliers.***</span>
    
    100. Describe some characteristics of data that become hidden when a boxplot is used
    instead of a dotplot or histogram. <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Dotplots and histograms can show the number of
    modes in a distribution, but a boxplot cannot. If a distribution is bimodal, we will
    not be able to tell in a boxplot. In general, we lose the ability to talk about the
    overall shape of the distribution.***</span>

11. Display the uncut version of the *Plot Match* file ([LMR_U2_L7_B](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_6.0/LMR_U2_L7_B.pdf)) so that students see the letters that
correspond to each set of representations.

    <span style="color:grey">***Solution key:***</span>

    <span style="color:grey">***Set 1: Plots (d), (a), (b)***</span>

    <span style="color:grey">***Set 2: Plots (m), (c), (h)***</span>

    <span style="color:grey">***Set 3: Plots (f), (j), (o)***</span>

    <span style="color:grey">***Set 4: Plots (e), (l), (i)***</span>

    <span style="color:grey">***Set 5: Plots (n), (k), (g)***</span>

12. Have a few students share out their responses. For homework, students will record some pros
and cons of using different types of graphical representations to display the same data.

###**Class Scribes:**
One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the
day were.

###<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Homework**</p>
Students should reflect on today’s class discussion and record their ideas of some pros and cons of using
different types of graphical representations to display the same data.
