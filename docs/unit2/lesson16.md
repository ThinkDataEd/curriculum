##**<u>Lesson 16: What is Normal?</u>**

###**Objective:**
Students will learn what a Normal distribution is and learn how to identify a Normal distribution.

###**Materials:**

###**Vocabulary:**
[bell-shaped](../../vocabulary/unit2/#bell-shaped "the bell shape that is created on a graph of a normal distribution"){ .md-button }
[normal curve](../../vocabulary/unit2/#normal-curve "curve or the graph is the common type of distribution for a variable"){ .md-button }

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    The Normal curve, also called the Gaussian distribution and the "bell curve," is a
    model that describes many real-life distributions and is usually called the Normal Model.

###**Lesson:**
1. Remind students that in [Unit 1](../unit1/overview.md), [Lesson 11](../unit1/lesson11.md) (*What Shape Are You In?*), they sorted histograms into
groups based on their shapes.

2. The *Normal Plots* file ([LMR_U2_L16](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_6.0/LMR_U2_L16.pdf)) contains some of the unimodal **bell-shaped** distributions from
the original handout of that lesson (*Sorting* Histograms handout ([LMR_U1_L11](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_6.0/LMR_U1_L11.pdf))).
    
    **<u>Note:</u>** You do not need the original handout from [Unit 1](../unit1/overview.md) – all relevant plots have been compiled in
    the *Normal Plots* file ([LMR_U2_L16](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_6.0/LMR_U2_L16.pdf)) for accessibility. Six plots are included: SAT Math, SAT Verb,
    ACT Mathematics, ACT Reading, ACT English, and ACT Science Reasoning.

3. Display the group of bell-shaped distributions from page 1 of the *Normal Plots* file ([LMR_U2_L16](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_6.0/LMR_U2_L16.pdf)) to
the class and ask the students:

    100. What characteristic does this particular group share? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: All of these plots are unimodal
    (one mode/peak) and symmetric.***</span>

    100. Inform students that these types of distributions are often referred to as bell-shaped. Why
    might this term be used? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: The histograms look very similar to the shape of a bell.***</span>

4. To show the similarities between the shape of a bell and the shape of these distributions, a clip-art
image (shown here) has been included in the *Normal Plots* file ([LMR_U2_L16](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_6.0/LMR_U2_L16.pdf)) on page 2.

5. Explain that this shape occurs often in real-life. It occurs so often that it’s been given its own
name: the **normal curve**, or **normal distribution**. Can the students think of distributions where
they have seen Normal curves in previous labs? <span style="color:grey">***A possible answer might be the height and weight histograms for the ```cdc``` data.***</span>

6. To give some more background on the normal distribution, play the New York Times video titled
“Bunnies, Dragons, and the Normal World” found at:
[http://www.nytimes.com/video/science/100000002452709/bunnies-dragons-and-the-normal-world.html](http://www.nytimes.com/video/science/100000002452709/bunnies-dragons-and-the-normal-world.html "http://www.nytimes.com/video/science/100000002452709/bunnies-dragons-and-the-normal-world.html"){:target="_blank"}

    **<u>Note:</u>** Show only the first 41 seconds of the video.

7. Discuss that the normal curve has a very precise mathematical definition, which is pretty complex.
But the result is a curve that looks like the one in the “Bunnies” video. In general, the curve looks
like the plot shown below.

    **<u>Note:</u>** You can either draw the diagram below on the board or display it via a projector – the
    image can be found on page 2 of the *Normal Plots* file ([LMR_U2_L16](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_6.0/LMR_U2_L16.pdf)).

    <center><img src="../../img/21607.png" /></center>

8. Explain that normal distributions are good for describing some populations of people. For
example, people’s heights are often considered to be normally distributed. Display the famous
Frank Anscombe photograph (shown below) via a projector. The graphic can be found on page 2
of the *Normal Plots* file ([LMR_U2_L16](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_6.0/LMR_U2_L16.pdf)). Inform the students that this photo was taken of a group of
randomly selected college women who stood in height order.

9. Next, lead a discussion about why the normal curve is a good fit to the histogram in the above
picture. Notice that more people are near the center of the distribution, and fewer are in the outer
edges, or tails. Engage the class in a conversation using the following probing questions:

    100. Notice that there is a peak in the center of the distribution. What height do you think is at
    the center? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: The average height of American women is approximately 5’5” (5 feet, 5
    inches) tall. We might therefore expect the average height of this group to be close
    to 5'5" as well.***</span>

    100. Why are more people in the center, and less people in the edges, or tails, of the
    distribution? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: The center represents the mean height. Most women will fall
    somewhere close to the mean and may be a few inches shorter or taller than it.
    However, less people are likely to be MUCH shorter or MUCH taller than the mean.
    For example, we would not expect to see many women who are 4’10” tall nor would
    we expect to see many women who are 6’0” tall.***</span>

10. Explain that the normal curve is a good description of a distribution when it makes sense that
there is a single 'typical' value with random deviations above and below that value. Ask students:

    100. Why does this make sense with heights but not with incomes? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: With heights, we expect
    most people to be near the average, with some deviations above and below the
    mean (people who are taller or shorter than the mean height). However, with
    incomes, the distribution will have more deviations that are above the typical value,
    since there is no upper bound for a maximum income (ex. Bill Gates, Warren
    Buffett, etc.).***</span>

    100. Are there more real-life examples, other than height, that students think might follow a
    normal distribution? <span style="color:grey">***Answers will vary by class. Some examples include: (1) scores
    on standardized math and reading tests (like the SAT and ACT), (2) IQ scores, and
    (3) body temperatures.***</span>

    100. Does it matter that the curve drawn on the photograph does not match exactly to the
    women’s heights? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: No. We often refer to the curve as the “normal model” because
    the curve is a just a model of the true population distribution. So, even though the
    red curve is not exactly the same as the women’s heights, it is a close enough
    approximation of the shape of their heights.***</span>

    **<u>Note to teacher:</u>** The main role the normal distribution has historically played has been in modeling errors
    (most measurements will be close to the actual value while larger errors occur less often) and
    sample means.

11. Inform the students that, during the next few lessons, they will be learning more about the normal
distribution. In particular, they will learn about a new measure of spread used to describe a
normal distribution, how to calculate probabilities from this distribution, and how to randomly
sample from this distribution.

12. *Cheat Card:* Distribute an index card to students and ask them to create a cheat card that will
help them remember information about the normal curve.

###**Class Scribes:**
One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the
day were.

###<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Homework**</p>
Students will complete their cheat cards if they were not able to finish in class.
