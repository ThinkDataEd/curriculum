#Unit 2, Section 1: What is Your True Color?#
Instructional Days: 7

##<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Enduring Understandings**</p>
Statistics enable us to make sense of large amounts of data. Numerical summaries capture important
elements of a distribution. Measures of center, also known as measures of central tendency, show the
tendency of quantitative data to gather around a central value. Measures of spread, also known as
measures of variability, show how much the quantitative data is spread out. Measurements of the
propensity for the data to cluster on a central location and the range of variability within the data can
provide insightful indicators about the data.

Students will complete the *True Colors Personality Test* to discover the qualities and characteristics of
their personality styles. Students will use the results from the personality color test to learn about
subsetting data and finding measures of center and spread. The data from their personality test will be
collected in a survey using the [IDS ThinkData Ed App](../download/app.md) or via web browser at [https://portal.thinkdataed.org](https://portal.thinkdataed.org "https://portal.thinkdataed.org"){:target="_blank"}

##<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Learning Objectives**</p>
<ins>*Statistical/Mathematical:*</ins>

A-SSE A: Interpret the structure of expressions.

S-ID 2: Use statistics appropriate to the shape of the data distribution to compare center (median, mean)
and spread (interquartile range, standard deviation) of two or more different data sets.

S-ID 3: Interpret differences in shape, center, and spread in the context of the data sets, accounting for
possible effects of extreme data points (outliers).

S-IC 6: Evaluate reports based on data.

<ins>*Focus Standards for Mathematical Practice for All of Unit 2:*</ins>

SMP-4: Model with mathematics.

SMP-5: Use appropriate tools strategically.

<ins>*Data Science:*</ins>

Understand the information that numerical summaries provide about the data. Understand that a boxplot
is a graphical representation of a numerical summary.

<ins>*Applied Computational Thinking using RStudio:*</ins>

• Calculate numerical summaries (mean, median, Mean of Absolute Deviations (MAD), and Interquartile Range (IQR)).

• Create graphical representations to compare two or more datasets, including boxplots.

<ins>*Real-World Connections:*</ins>

We must be able to synthesize vast amounts of data into coherent, comprehensible measures. Today’s
media is continuously publishing articles that include statistical references. Critical consumerism requires
that we understand the information provided in summaries of data.

##<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Language Objectives**</p>
1. Students will consider the appropriateness of using mean or median as the measure of center for different types of distributions.

2. Students will determine and explain appropriate measures of spread.

3. Students will engage in an "Active Debate" activity to compare shape, center, and spread of distributions.

4. Students will engage in partner and whole group distributions and presentations to express their understanding of statistical investigations.

##<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Data File or Data Collection Method**</p>
<ins>*Data Files:*</ins>

1. Students’ *Personality Color* survey: ```data(colors)```

<ins>*Data Collection Method:*</ins>

**True Colors Personality Test:** Students will complete the *Personality Color* survey that will
collect their data about their personality styles.
