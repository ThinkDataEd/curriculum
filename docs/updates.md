Changes that have been made to version 7.0

**All Units**

 - Naming convention of LMRs have been updated to match Unit and Lesson (example: LMR_1.1_Data Diary is now LMR_U1_L1)
 - All preloaded datasets have been updated to reflect original variable names (example: ```cdc``` gender variable is sex variable in original documentation)
 - ```cdc```, ```atus```, and ```futbol``` datasets have been updated to more recent data

**Unit 1**

 - Lesson 5: Oscar winners data has been updated
 - Lesson 14: LMR_U1_L14_B and LMR_U1_L14_D use sex variable instead of gender
 - Practicum: The Summaries: Third example uses sex variable instead of gender

**Unit 2**

 - Lesson 9: Changed "biased" to "unfair"
 - Lesson 17: Changed household size to household activities (```atus``` variable change)

**Unit 3**

 - Lesson 8: Updated spurious correlations images/examples due to update in spurious correlations website
 - Lesson 21: Lesson now compares HTML code to XML code (via website viewer), LMR has been udpated to reflect changes in lesson
 - Lesson 22: Lesson now goes through how to convert XML code to data table in RStudio, LMR has been updated to reflect changes in lesson

 - Labs now also have text which direct students to complete tasks within the RStudio/Posit interface in <span style="color:midnightblue;">**blue**</span> font
 - GPS no longer reports precise location
 - There are anonymized datasets available for the Food Habits, Personality Colors, and Time Use (unformatted) Campaigns. They can be accessed by running the following code:
        
        extra_data('food_ids')
        extra_data('color_ids')
        extra_data('timeuse_ids')

**Unit 1**

 - Food Habits and Time Use campaign questions, in the campaign guidelines, have been modified for clarity
 - Lesson 1: LMR_1.1 changed "Facebook" to "TikTok"

 - Section 2 also caps off with non-linear models with Lesson 13: Improving your Model (previously Lesson 14)
 - Section 3 is now Piecing it Together with only the two lessons on multivariable regression
 - The lessons in Section 4 have been slightly rearranged - part of Lesson 17 was moved to Lesson 16 for better building of concepts.

 - The End of Unit Project is student choice around a community issue
 - Unit 4 Assessments have been updated (access through the Documents tool on Portal) - link to lungs data and solutions.
