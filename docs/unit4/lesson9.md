##***<u>Lesson 9: The Spaghetti Line</u>***

###**Objective:**
Students will estimate the line of best fit for a height and arm span dataset using a strand of spaghetti as
a modeling tool.

###**Materials:**
1. *The Spaghetti Line* handout ([LMR_U4_L9](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit4_v_7/LMR_U4_L9.pdf))

    **<u>Advance preparation required:</u>** Cut out plots prior to beginning the lesson (see step 2 in lesson)

2. 1 lb. of Uncooked Spaghetti

3. Grid Paper

4. Tape or Glue

5. Poster paper

###**Vocabulary:**
[line of best fit](../../vocabulary/unit4/#line-of-best-fit "a line through a scatterplot of data points that best expresses the relationship between those points"){ .md-button }

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    We can often use a straight line to summarize a trend. “Eyeballing” a straight line to a
    scatterplot is one way to do this.

###**Lesson:**
<u>**Note:**</u> Lab 4A may be done in the same class period as this lesson.

1. Inform students that in this lesson, they will estimate the equation of the *line of best fit* for a height and arm span dataset.

2. Distribute *The Spaghetti Line* handout ([LMR_U4_L9](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit4_v_7/LMR_U4_L9.pdf)) to each student and a couple of
spaghetti strands per team. Students will estimate the line of best fit as outlined in the handout.
Team solutions should be recorded on poster paper. They will glue their assigned plot on the
poster and record their responses to the questions on the poster paper.

    **<u>Advance preparation required:</u>** Cut out the plots on pages 2-4, one for each group. If there are more than 6 groups, plots can be duplicated for remaining groups.
    
    **<u>Note to teacher:</u>** If necessary, review how to find the slope of a line using two points and how to
    write an equation using the slope and y-intercept. Students may need extra help with finding the correct y-intercept because they cannot rely on the y-axis values in this case since the plots are not starting at the origin, (0,0).

3. Ask teams to post their work around the room. Conduct a *Gallery Walk* so that teams can see
each other’s work.

4. Lead a discussion about the teams’ lines. Ask: Which team has the best line? Why?

    **<u>Note to teacher:</u>** Push the students a bit by adding an obviously bad line to the graph and asking
    why their line is better than this one. Push them to come to an understanding that the “best” line
    comes close to the *most* points and this line is called the **line of best fit**.

###**Class Scribes:**
One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the
day were.
