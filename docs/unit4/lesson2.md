2. *Landfill Readiness Questions* handout ([LMR_4.1_Landfill Readiness Questions](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 4_v_6.0/LMR_4.1_Landfill Readiness Questions.pdf))

3. *Trash Campaign Exploration* handout ([LMR_4.2_Trash Campaign Exploration ](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 4_v_6.0/LMR_4.2_Trash Campaign Exploration.pdf))

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: " 
    Exploring different datasets can give us insight about the same processes. Information from an official dataset compared with a participatory sensing dataset can yield more information than one dataset alone.

###**Lesson:**
1. Inform students that they will investigate a problem that faces many cities in the United States today: trash.

2. Using the 5 Ws strategy, ask students to write down the 5 Ws in their DS journals as they watch a video about trash. The 5 Ws summarize the What, Who, Why, When, and Where of the resource.

3. Play the Fighting Plastic Pollution Through Data video, found at: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOYAIXjHveA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOYAIXjHveA "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOYAIXjHveA"){:target="_blank"} <br> **NOTE**: While the video is just over 13 minutes long, students should be able to answer the 5 Ws from the content of the firt 10 minutes.

4. After they have finished watching the video, engage in a class discussion around the following questions and discuss their insights, questions, and/or reactions to the video:

    100. What types of data did they collect in the video? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Photos, location, brand names, weight (kg), waste categories (plastic bags, straws, toothpaste, etc), and number of packaging.***</span>

    100. How are they useful in fighting plastic pollution? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Brand accountability, community involvement, cleaning rivers/ dumping sites, and finding sources of pollution.***</span>

5. Now we'll take inventory of our own understanding of landfills and how trash travels there. Distribute the *Landfill Readiness Questions* handout ([LMR_4.1_Landfill Readiness Questions](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 4_v_6.0/LMR_4.1_Landfill Readiness Questions.pdf)). Allow students private think-time before having them discuss in their teams.

6. Let students now that they will be exploring data from a trash Participatory Sensing campaign, titled the “Trash Campaign,” that was conducted at a number of high schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD).

7. Concerned students in LAUSD engaged in a model eliciting activity and created a trash participatory sensing campaign to investigate possible trash issues in their communities. Based on the data collected, they made recommendations to the Los Angeles County Sanitation District (LACSD) that would help reduce the use of the regional landfills.

8. Distribute the *Trash Campaign Exploration* handout ([LMR_4.2_Trash Campaign Exploration](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 4_v_6.0/LMR_4.2_Trash Campaign Exploration.pdf)) to assist in students' interaction with the IDS public dashboard.

9. Navigate students will to the IDS public dashboard:
[https://portal.idsucla.org](https://portal.idsucla.org "https://portal.idsucla.org"){:target="_blank"}

10. They should use the “Trash” campaign data and select “Dashboard” from the “Action” button.

11. The dashboard is a visual tool for exploring and analyzing data. An example screenshot of the Trash campaign in the dashboard is shown below. <img src="../../img/41509.png" />

12. Students should “play” with the data and think about characteristics of the campaign. Answers to the questions in LMR_4.2 are provided here for reference:

    100. How many observations are in this data set? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: 2,631.***</span>

    100. Where was the majority of trash generated? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: School (1,254).***</span>

    100. How many observations were generated at school? At work? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: School has 1,254 and Work has 59..***</span>

    100. What material or item was most commonly thrown away? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Recyclable (1,302) or Paper (477).***</span>

    100. Between what hours is the largest percentage of trash generated at home? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Between 2100 and 2200, which is 9pm to 10pm (106).***</span>

    100. Which activity generates the largest percentage of landfill-destined trash? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Eating/cooking with 69.02% (822/1,191).***</span>

    100. Is eating or drinking more likely to generate a recyclable piece of trash? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Drinking, because it resulted in 480 recyclables versus Eating resulted in 399 recyclables, out of 1,302 total.***</span>

    100. When recycle bins were present, did a higher proportion of recyclable items end up in the trash bin when people were at home or at school? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: School (134/225) had a higher proportion of recyclable items end up in the trash than Home (76/225).***</span>

    100. When someone littered, how many times was the person not arround any type of waste receptacle? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: 15 out of 58.***</span>

13. Take time at the end of class to share out and discuss the components of the Trash Campaign. If needed, you may use the *Trash Campaign Creation* handout ([LMR_4.3_Trash Campaign Creation](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 4_v_6.0/LMR_4.3_Trash Campaign Creation.pdf)) as an additional resource to help with the distribution of the Trash Campaign.

###**Class Scribes:**
One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.
