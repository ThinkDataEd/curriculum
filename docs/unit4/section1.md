##<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Enduring Understandings**</p>
Modeling Activities are posed as open-ended problems that are designed to challenge students to build models in order to solve complex, real-world problems. They may be used to engage students in statistical reasoning and provide a means to better understand students' thinking.

##<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Engagement**</p>
Students will watch a video called *Fighting Pollution Through Data*.
This video will set the context of the real-world problem facing many cities around the world — trash. The
video provides background information as well as a baseline topic to launch ideas for the modeling process. The video can be found at: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOYAIXjHveA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOYAIXjHveA "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOYAIXjHveA"){:target="_blank"}

<ins>*Statistical/Mathematical:*</ins>

According to the California Common Core State Standards-Mathematics (CCSS-M) Framework:

“Modeling links classroom mathematics and statistics to everyday life, work, and decision-making.
Modeling is the process of choosing and using appropriate mathematics and statistics to analyze
empirical situations, to understand them better, and to improve decisions. Quantities and their
relationships in physical, economic, public policy, social, and everyday situations can be modeled using
mathematical and statistical methods. When making mathematical models, technology is valuable for
varying assumptions, exploring consequences, and comparing predictions with data."

<ins>*Focus Standards for Mathematical Practice:*</ins>

SMP-4: Model with mathematics.

<ins>*Data Science:*</ins>

Students will apply the conceptual understandings learned up to this point in the curriculum.

<ins>*Applied Computational Thinking using RStudio:*</ins>

• Previous techniques from the curriculum will be used in order to complete the task.

<ins>*Real-World Connections:*</ins>

Engineers, data scientists, and statisticians, to name a few, use modeling in their everyday work. Whether
it is for creating a scale model of a bridge or a mathematical model of force impact measures, modeling is
an integral part of what they do in the real world.


##<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Language Objectives**</p>
1. Students will use complex sentences to construct summary statements about their understanding
of data, how it is collected, how it used, and how to work with it.

2. Students will engage in partner and whole group discussions to express their
understanding of data science concepts.

3. Students will read informative texts to evaluate claims based on data.

##<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Data File or Data Collection Method**</p>
<ins>*Data File:*</ins>

1. Trash: data (trash)
