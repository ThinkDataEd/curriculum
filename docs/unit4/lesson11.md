##***<u>Lesson 11: What’s the Trend?</u>***

###**Objective:**
Students will understand that the regression line is a model for a linear association (trend). They will learn
to identify the direction of trends and interpret the slope and the intercept of a linear model in the context of the data.

###**Materials:**
1. *What’s the Trend?* handout ([LMR_U4_L11_A](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit4_v_7/LMR_U4_L11_A.pdf))

2. *Predicting Values* handout ([LMR_U4_L11_B](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit4_v_7/LMR_U4_L11_B.pdf))

###**Vocabulary:**
[trend](../../vocabulary/unit4/#trend "often referred to as a line of best fit, is a line that is used to represent the behavior of a set of data to determine if there is a certain pattern"){ .md-button }
[positive association](../../vocabulary/unit4/#possitive-association "when the values of one variable tend to increase as the values of the other variable increase"){ .md-button }
[negative association](../../vocabulary/unit4/#negative-association "when the values of one variable tend to decrease as the values of the other variable increase"){ .md-button }
[no association](../../vocabulary/unit4/#no-association "means that there is no line and all the dots are scattered"){ .md-button }
[linear](../../vocabulary/unit4/#linear "used to describe a straight-line relationship between two variables"){ .md-button }
[model](../../vocabulary/unit4/#model "a mathematical model that embodies a set of statistical assumptions concerning the generation of sample data (and similar data from a larger population)"){ .md-button }

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: " 
    A positive or negative association between variables provides valuable insights into increasing or decreasing trends, particularly in making predictions. By understanding these associations, we can anticipate future outcomes or behaviors more accurately.

###**Lesson:**
1. Distribute *What’s the Trend?* handout ([LMR_U4_L11_A](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit4_v_7/LMR_U4_L11_A.pdf)). Students will analyze the two scatterplots on the
handout. The *Profits per Explosion* plot shows the relationship between the number of explosions
in Michael Bay’s movies and the profit earned by each movie. The *Scores Over Time* plot shows
the relationship between M. Night Shyamalan movies made since *The Sixth Sense* was released
in 1999 and their Internet Movie Database (IMBD) scores.

2. In teams, students will discuss and record their responses to the following questions for each plot:

    <img src="../../img/41102.png" />

    100. What kind of plot is this? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Scatterplot.***</span>

    100. What do the numbers on the x-axis represent? What do the numbers on the y-axis
    represent? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: The x-axis shows number of explosions and y-axis shows box office gross in
    millions of dollars.***</span>

    100. What is this plot telling us? <span style="color:grey">***Answers will vary. One example could be that if there are
    more explosions in a movie, then the movie will earn a greater box office gross.***</span>

    <img src="../../img/41102d.png" />

    100. What kind of plot is this? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Scatterplot.***</span>

    100. What do the numbers on the x-axis represent? What do the numbers on the y-axis
    represent? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: The x-axis shows the number of years since 1999 and the y-axis shows
    the movie’s IMDB score.***</span>

    100. What is this plot telling us? <span style="color:grey">***Answers will vary. One example could be that as M. Night
    Shyamalan has produced more movies, their IMDB ratings have gone down.***</span>

3. Allow students time to discuss and record their answers to the questions.

4. Display both plots, if possible (students may also refer to the plots in their own handout). Discuss
the following questions with the whole class:

    * What is happening in each plot? What seems to be the trend? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Guide students to understand that the Box Office Gross per Explosion plot shows an increasing trend, while the
    Scores Over Time plot shows a decreasing trend. An increasing ***</span>***trend***<span style="color:grey">*** is called a
     ***</span>***positive association***<span style="color:grey">*** and a decreasing ***</span>***trend***<span style="color:grey">*** is called a  ***</span>***negative association***<span style="color:grey">***.***</span>

    * What does it mean to have an increasing trend and a positive association? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: In Box Office Gross per
    Explosion, it means that as the number of explosions increase, the movie box office gross also
    increase.***</span>

    * What does it mean to have a decreasing trend and a negative association? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: In Scores Over
    Time, it means that as the years after 1999 pass, the movie IMBD ratings decrease.***</span>

5. Quickwrite: What if we had a plot with **no association**? Ask students to sketch what they think a
scatterplot that shows no association looks like. <span style="color:grey">***Answer: A correct sketch will show a scatterplot with
data points that show no positive or negative association; no trend or pattern. There
would be no association or a very weak one. The data would be scattered.***</span>

6. Select a couple of sketches to share with the whole class. Discuss why the sketches show no
association.

7. Ask students to discuss their thoughts about why a line was drawn through the points of the two
plots and why there are equations for each plot.

8. Conduct a share out of their observations. Guide students to the understanding that both plots follow a **linear** trend. This line then represents a **model** for the relationship between the two variables. The
equations shown in the plots above represent the lines through the points. They provide a description
of the data and the relationship between the variables.

9. Ask student teams to refer back to the *What’s the Trend?* handout ([LMR_U4_L11_A](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit4_v_7/LMR_U4_L11_A.pdf)). They should discuss
the following questions and record their responses on the *Predicting Values* handout ([LMR_U4_L11_B](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit4_v_7/LMR_U4_L11_B.pdf)):

    <div align="right"><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https://ids-curriculum.idsucla.org/IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit4_v_7/LMR_U4_L11_B.pdf&embedded=true" style=" width:420px;height:400px;" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>[LMR_U4_L11_B](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit4_v_7/LMR_U4_L11_B.pdf)</div>

    100. What do you notice about where the points are and where the line is? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Some points are
    near the line, others are further away, and one point is just slightly touching the line(but not exactly on it).***</span>

    100. Recall from Algebra that every line can be represented by an equation in the form
    y=mx+b. In this case, the equation of the regression line is y=0.685xx+94.093.
    What do the x- and y-values represent in this equation? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: The x-values represent the
    number of explosions and the y-values represent the predicted box office gross.***</span>

    100. According to the equation, what is the slope of this line? What does the slope mean in
    relation to the number of explosions? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: The slope is 0.685. It is the rate of change
    between the number of explosions and the box office gross. It means that for every explosion
    increase of 1 the box office gross increases by 0.685 dollars.***</span>

    100. When the number of explosions (x-value) is zero, what is the box office gross (y-value)? How do you
    know? What does this mean? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: The box office gross is 94.093 million dollars. Students may
    use the equation to show that they substituted zero for x, so the y-intercept is the
    box office gross. It means that if Michael Bay were to make a movie with NO explosions, this
    would be his projected box office gross.***</span>

    100. If you wanted to know the box office gross for the point that lies the closest to the line, what would
    the equation be? Write the equation and solve it. <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Box Office Gross=0.685(380)+94.093.
    Profit=354.393 or 354,3930400 million dollars.***</span>

    100. What was the actual box office gross for the point that lies closest to the line? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: The actual box office gross was
    352,400,000 million dollars.

    100. What if Michael Bay made a movie that had 275 explosions? What would his predicted
    profit be? Show how you arrived at the solution. <span style="color:grey">***Answer: By substituting 275 in the value of x in
    the equation, predicted profit will be $282,468,000 or 282.468 in millions of dollars, or by finding
    the point on the line or both.***</span>

10. If time permits, have students answer the following questions about the *Scores Over Time* scatterplot in [LMR_U4_L11_A](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit4_v_7/LMR_U4_L11_A.pdf).

    100. What do you notice about where the points are and where the line is? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Some points are near the line, others are further away, and three points are very close to the line (with one slightly touching it but not exactly on the line).***</span>

    100. What do the y- and x-values represent in this equation? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: The x-values represent the number of years since 1999 and the y-values represent the IMDB score.***</span>

    100. According to the equation, what is the slope of this line? What does the slope mean?<span style="color:grey">***Answer: The slope is -0.04377. It is the reate of change between the number of years since 1999 and the IMDB score. It means that for every year since 1999 increase of 1 the IMDB score decreases by 0.04377.***</span>

    100. When the x-value is zero, what is the y-value? How do you know? What does this mean? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: The IMDB score, the y-value, is 6.68592. Students may use the equation to show that they substituted zero for x, so the y-intercept is the IMDB score. It means that if M. Night Shyamalan were to make a movie in 1999, this would be his projected IMDB score, regardless of the movie type or other factors. While knowing the y-intercept allows us to make predictions using this model, the intercept does not have any meaningful interpretation for this model (it's not possible to go back in time to have M. Night Shyamalan produce another movie in 1999).***</span>

    100. What would the predicted value of the score be if M. Night Shyamalan released a movie in 2030? How do you know? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: By substituting 31, because 2030 - 1999 = 31, in the value of x in the equation, the predicted IMDB score will be 5.32905, or by finding the point on the line or both.***</span>
