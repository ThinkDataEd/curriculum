##**<u>Lab 1D - Zooming Through Data</u>**

Directions: Follow along with the slides, completing the questions in <span style="color:midnightblue;">**blue**</span> on your computer, and answering the questions in <span style="color:firebrick;">**red**</span> in your journal.

###**Data with Clarity**
* Previously, we've looked at graphs of entire variables (by looking at all of their values).

    – Doing this is helpful to get a *big picture* idea of our data.

* In this lab, we'll learn how to *zoom in* on our data by learning how to subset.

    – We'll also learn a few ways to manipulate the plots we've been making to make them easier to use for analyses.

* Import the data from your class's *Food Habits* campaign and name it ```food```.

###**Another plotting function**
* A ```dotPlot``` is another plot that can be used to analyze a numerical variable.

    – Dotplots are better suited for smaller datasets. If datasets are too large, the dots become too small to see.

    – Similarly, distributions with a large spread might impact the readability of the plot.

* <span style="color:firebrick;">**(1) Write and run code for creating a ```dotPlot``` of the amount of ```sugar``` in our ```food``` data.**</span>

    – The code to create a ```dotPlot``` is exactly like you’d use to make a ```histogram```.

    – Make sure to use a capital *P* in ```dotPlot```.

###**More options**
* While a ```dotPlot``` should conserve the exact value of each data point, sometimes it behaves like a ```histogram``` in that it lumps values together.

* <span style="color:firebrick;">**(2) Write and run the code for a more accurate ```dotPlot``` by including the ```nint``` option.**</span>

    – Set ```nint``` equal to the maximum value for ```sugar``` minus the minimum value for ```sugar``` plus one.
    
    * <span style="color:midnightblue;">**On your ```food``` data spreadsheet, click on the ```sugar``` header to sort in ascending order (to obtain minimum).**</span>

    * <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Click on the ```sugar``` header again to sort in descending order (to obtain maximum).**</span>

    – <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Use your *History* pane to see how we included the option ```nint``` with the ```histogram``` function.**</span>

* Pro-tip: If the ```dotPlot``` comes out looking wonky, try changing the value of the *character expansion* option, ```cex```. 

    – The default value is ```1```. Try a few values between ```0``` and ```1``` and a few more values larger than ```1```.

###**Splitting datasets**
* In [Lab 1B](lab1b.md), we learned that we can *facet* (or split) our data based on a categorical variable.

* <span style="color:firebrick;">**(3) Write and run code splitting the ```dotPlot``` displaying the distribution of grams of ```sugar``` in two, by faceting on our observations’ ```salty_sweet``` variable.**</span>

    – <span style="color:firebrick;">**(4) Describe how ```R``` decides which observations go into the left or right plot.**</span>

    – <span style="color:firebrick;">**(5) What does each *dot* in the plot represent?**</span>

###**Altering the layout**
* It would be much easier to compare the ```sugar``` levels of salty and sweet snacks if the dotPlots were stacked on top of one another.

* We can change the *layout* of our separated plots by including the ```layout``` option in our ```dotPlot``` function.

    – <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Add the following option to the code you used to create the ```dotPlot``` split by ```salty_sweet```.**</span>

        layout = c(1,2)

* Hint: Use a similar syntax used with the ```nint``` option to add the ```layout``` option to the ```dotPlot``` function.

###**Subsetting**
* Subsetting is a term we use to describe the process of looking at only the data that conforms to some set of rules:

    – Geologists may subset earthquake data by looking at only large earthquakes.

    – Stock market traders may subset their trading data by looking only at the previous day's trades.

* There are *many* ways to subset data using RStudio, we'll focus on learning the most common methods.

###**The filter function**
* Creating a plot for ```Salty``` and a plot for ```Sweet``` is useful for comparing ```Salty``` and ```Sweet```. What if we want to examine one group by itself?

* The line of code below creates a subset of the ```food``` dataset containing only ```Salty``` snacks. We will break it down piece by piece in the next few slides.

* <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Run the line of code below.**</span>

        food_salty <- filter(food, salty_sweet == "Salty")

* <span style="color:firebrick;">**(6) ```View``` ```food_salty``` and write down the number of observations in it.**</span>

###**So what's really going on?**

* Coding in ```R``` is really just about supplying directions in a way that ```R``` understands.

    – We'll start by focusing on everything to the right of the ```<-``` symbol

        food_salty <- filter(food, salty_sweet == "Salty")

* ```filter()``` tells ```R``` that we're going to look at only the values in our data that follow a *rule*.

* The first blank should be the data we're going to filter down into a smaller set (based on our rule).

* ```salty_sweet == "Salty"``` is the rule to follow.

###**3 parts of defining rules**
* We can decompose our rule, ```salty_sweet == "Salty"```, into 3 parts:

    (1) ```salty_sweet```, is the particular *variable* we want to use to select our subset.

    (2) ```"Salty"``` is the *value* of the variable that we want to select. We only want to see data with the value ```Salty``` for the variable ```salty_sweet```.

    (3) ```==``` describes how we want to relate our variable (```salty_sweet```) to our value (```"Salty"```). In this case, we want values of ```salty_sweet``` that are *exactly equal* to ```"Salty"```.

* Notice: *Values* (that are also words) have quotation marks around them. *Variables* do not.

###**More on ==**
* We can use the ```head()``` function to help us see what's happening when we write ```salty_sweet == "Salty"```.

    – ```head()``` returns the values of the first 6 observations.

    – The ```tail()``` function returns the last 6 observations.

* <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Run the following code and answer the question below:**</span>

        head(~salty_sweet == "Salty", data = food)

* <span style="color:firebrick;">**(7) What do the values ```TRUE``` and ```FALSE``` tell us about how our *rule* applies to the first six snacks in our data? Which of the first six observations were ```Salty```?**</span>

###**Saving values**
* To use our subset data we need to save it first.

    – When we *save* something in ```R``` what we are really doing is giving a value, or set of values, a specific name for us to use later.

* The arrow ```<-``` is called the "assignment" operator. It assigns names (on the left) to values (on the right)

    – We now focus on everything to the left of, and including, the ```<-``` symbol

        food_salty <- filter(food, salty_sweet == "Salty")

###**Saving our subset**
        food_salty <- filter(food, salty_sweet == "Salty")

* This code then:

    – takes our subset data, (everything to the right of ```<-```) ...

    – and assigns the subset data, by using the arrow ```<-``` ...

    – the name ```food_salty```.

* We can now use ```food_salty``` to do anything we could do with the regular ```food``` data ...

    – but only including those snacks who reported being ```Salty```.

* As a result of assigning the subset data to ```food_salty```, ```food_salty``` now appears in the *Environment* pane. Whenever data is assigned to a variable name, that variable name will appear in the *Environment* pane.

* <span style="color:firebrick;">**(8) Write and run code using ```food_salty``` to make a ```dotPlot``` of the ```sodium``` in our ```Salty``` snacks.**</span>

###**Including more filters**
* We often want to filter our data based on multiple rules.

    – For instance, we might want to filter our ```food``` data based on the food being salty AND having less than 200 calories.

* We can include multiple filters to our subsets by separating each rule with a comma like so:

        my_sub <- filter(food , salty_sweet == "Salty", calories < 200)

* <span style="color:midnightblue;">**```View``` the ```my_sub``` data we filtered in the above line of code and verify that it only includes salty snacks that have less than 200 calories.**</span>

###**Put it all together**
* <span style="color:firebrick;">**(9) Create a ```dotPlot``` and answer the question: About how much ```sugar``` does the typical sweet snack have **</span>

* <span style="color:firebrick;">**(10) Create a ```dotPlot``` and answer the question: How does the typical amount of ```sugar``` compare when ```healthy_level < 3``` and when ```healthy_level > 3```?**</span>

* Because you are now working with subsets of data, it is important to label our plots and make this distinction.

    – We can use the ```main``` option to add a title to our plots

    * <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Add the following option to the code you used to create the ```dotPlot``` of the ```sugar``` in ```Sweet``` snacks.**</span>

        ```main = "Distribution of sugar in sweet snacks"```
