##**<u>Practicum: The Data Cycle & My Food Habits</u>**

###**Objective:**
Students will apply what they have learned by engaging in the Data Cycle using the data they
collected from the *Food Habits* campaign. Students will present their findings to the class.

###**Materials:**
1. *The Data Cycle Practicum* ([LMR_U1_Practicum_Data_Cycle](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_6.0/LMR_U1_Practicum_Data_Cycle.pdf))

2. Poster paper

3. Markers

**<center>Practicum</center>**

**<center>The Data Cycle & My Food Habits</center>**

###**Instructions:**
With a partner, you will engage in the Data Cycle to address the Research Topic:

**<center>What do our snacking habits reveal about us?</center>**

###**Task:**
1. Create a Data Cycle poster.

2. The poster should illustrate how the Data Cycle is used to address the Research Topic.

3. Use RStudio to create at least one statistical graphic. The graphic MUST be included on the
poster.

4. You and your partner will present your findings with appropriate evidence from the data.

###**Awards:**

Your teacher will select the top posters in the following categories:

* Best Statistical Question

* Most Interesting Statistical Graphic

* Best Illustration of the Data Cycle

###**Scoring Guide:**

Below you will find some parameters to assist you in scoring. They are meant only as a
guide.

4-point response:

* The poster correctly illustrates how the Data Cycle is used to address the big question.

* A histogram, bar chart, scatterplot, or other graphical representation was correctly created.

* An answer and a justification for the answer to the statistical question are presented.

* A justification includes mention of statistics concepts learned thus far. For example, “The
variables are…” **<u>AND</u>** it includes acknowledgment of variability. For example, “There are between
<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> and <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>.”

3-point response:

* The poster correctly illustrates how the Data Cycle is used to address the big question.

* A histogram, bar chart, scatterplot, or other graphical representation was correctly created.

* An answer and a justification for the answer to the statistical question are presented.

* A justification includes mention of statistics concepts learned thus far. For example, “The
variables are…” **<u>OR</u>** it includes acknowledgment of variability. For example, “There are between
<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> and <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>.”

2-point response:

* The poster partially illustrates how the Data Cycle is used to address the big question.

* A histogram, bar chart, scatterplot, or other graphical representation was created.

* An answer and a justification for the answer to the statistical question are presented.

1-point response:

* The poster incorrectly illustrates how the Data Cycle addresses the big question.

* An answer to the statistical question is presented but a justification is missing.

* A histogram, bar chart, scatterplot, or other graphical representation was correctly created.

0-point response:

* The Data Cycle is missing **<u>OR</u>** does not show how it addresses the big question.

* A histogram, a dot plot, or other graphical representation was incorrectly created OR is missing.

* No answer **<u>AND/OR</u>** no justification for the answer to the statistical question is presented.
