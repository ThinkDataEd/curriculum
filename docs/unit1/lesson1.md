##**<u>Lesson 1: Data Trails</u>**

###**Objective:**
Students will understand what are data, how they are collected, and possible effects of sharing data.

**<u>Note:</u>** Students should have completed the IDS Survey and LOCUS Assessment before teaching this lesson. See Addendum_IDS_Survey_LOCUS in the Documents tool on [Portal](https://portal.thinkdataed.org) for more information.

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    Data are a collection of recorded observations. Data are gathered by people and
    by sensors. Patterns in data can reveal previously unknown patterns in our world. Data play a large, and
    sometimes invisible, role in our lives.

###**Lesson:**

!!! warning "Before implementing the IDS curriculum, ensure that:"
    a) Students have been placed in teams and each student understands his or
    her role in the team.

    b) Each student knows who his/her partner is within each team.

    c) Expectations regarding collaborative teamwork are discussed and
    understood (see [Team Roles](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/4_IDS_Teacher Resources_v_5.0/TR_CPM_Team Roles.pdf) in [Teacher Resources](../download/resources.md)).


1. Introduce the lesson by showing *The Target Story* video:<br>
    [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvSA-6BJkx4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvSA-6BJkx4 "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvSA-6BJkx4"){:target="_blank"}

2. In pairs, ask students to discuss the following question using the *TPS* strategy (see [Instructional
Strategies](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/4_IDS_Teacher Resources_v_5.0/TR_Instructional Strategies.pdf) in [Teacher Resources](../download/resources.md)):

    100. How do you think Target knew about the daughter? In other words, how did Target know
    the daughter was pregnant before her father did? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Target used the information
    gathered from the daughter’s Red Card and compared it to information about other
    shoppers. Typically, women who bought those particular products were pregnant.***</span>

3. After students have had time to share their responses, engage in a whole class discussion
regarding:

    100. What are **data**? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Data are information, or ***</span> ***observations***<span style="color:grey">***, that have been gathered and 
    recorded.***</span>

    100. Where do data come from? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Data can come from a variety of places. Some examples
    might include: cell phones, computers, school records, surveys, etc.***</span>

    100. Give an example of data. <span style="color:grey">***Answers will vary. One example might be information
    about a person – including their age, height, weight, eye color, etc.***</span>

    100. Give an example of something that is not data (e.g., something that was never written
    down). <span style="color:grey">***Answers will vary. One example might be just watching an event happen. If
    it wasn’t recorded in some way, it cannot be counted as data.***</span>

4. Explain to the students that we create **"data trails"** as we go through life. A data trail is the data
collected about us as individuals that could be used to see the patterns in our personal lives.
Inform the students that they will learn about their own data trails by keeping a data diary and
logging entries over the next 24 hours. It is likely that students do not realize how often they leave a data trail or what information is being collected about them on a regular basis.

5. Distribute the *Data Diary* handout ([LMR_U1_L1](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_6.0/LMR_U1_L1.pdf)) and be sure to go over the instructions, along with
the first example to give the students an idea of how to proceed.  

    <div align="right"><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https://curriculum.thinkdataed.org/IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_6.0/LMR_U1_L1.pdf&embedded=true" style=" width:420px;height:400px;" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>[LMR_U1_L1](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_6.0/LMR_U1_L1.pdf)</div>  


6. Inform the students that you will collect the handouts during the next class in order to assess their
understanding of data.

7. To get students thinking about what happens to their data, show the *Terms and Conditions* video:<br>
    [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcjtEKNP05c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcjtEKNP05c "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcjtEKNP05c"){:target="_blank"}

8. Engage the students in a whole class discussion about the video, particularly noting:

    100. What terms in the **privacy** statements were concerning or worrisome?

    100. Do you read the agreements when you download phone apps?

###**Class Scribes:**
One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics
of the day were. Be prepared to facilitate a good discussion and to ask probing questions in order
for students to elaborate on their thinking so that vague responses such as “we learned about
data” can be avoided.

###<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Homework**</p>
Students will complete the *Data Diary* handout. When grading the homework, be aware of
whether the data really could be collected, and whether the students' ideas about how the data
might be used are reasonable. For instance, students will often imagine that there is a "spy"
watching them; this is not what we are after. We are after actual instances in which sensors or
electronic surveillance records their actions or records information about them. For example,
"someone saw me going into the store" is not valid data for this exercise, but "a camera recorded
me entering the store" is valid data.
