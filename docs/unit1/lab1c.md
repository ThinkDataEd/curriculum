##**<u>Lab 1C - Export, Upload, Import</u>**

Directions: Follow along with the slides, completing the questions in <span style="color:midnightblue;">**blue**</span> on your computer, and answering the questions in <span style="color:firebrick;">**red**</span> in your journal.

###**Whose data? Our data.**
* Throughout the previous labs, we've been using data that was already loaded in RStudio.

    – But what if we want to analyze our own data?
    
* This lab is all about learning how to load our own Participatory Sensing data into RStudio.

###**Export, upload, import**
* Before we can perform any analysis, we have to load data into ```R```.

* When we want to get our Participatory Sensing data into RStudio, we:

    – <span style="color:darkgreen;">Export</span> the data from your class’s campaign page.

    – <span style="color:darkgreen;">Upload</span> data to *RStudio* server

    – <span style="color:darkgreen;">Import</span> the data into ```R```'s working memory

    * *Note: You can watch the following video for a step-by-step walk-through of the process:*

###**Exporting**
* <span style="color:midnightblue;">**To begin, go to the IDS Tools page**</span>

    – <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Click on the</span> <span style="color:darkgreen;">Campaign Manager</span><span style="color:midnightblue;">.**</span>

    – <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Fill in your username and password and click "Sign in".**</span>

    <img src="../../img/1xc0a.png" />

    If you forget your username or password, ask your teacher to remind you.

###**Campaign Manager**

<img src="../../img/1xc0b.png" />

* After logging in, your screen should look similar to this.

* <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Click on the dropdown arrow for the campaign you are interested in downloading.**</span>

    – At this point in the course, it will most likely be the Food Habits campaign.

###**Dropdown Arrow**
* The options for the dropdown menu will look like this:

    <img src="../../img/1xc0c.png" style="width:130px;height:220px;"/>

* <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Click on the option labeled</span> <span style="color:darkgreen;">Export Data</span><span style="color:midnightblue;">.**</span>

    – Remember where you save your file!

###**Exporting**
* When you clicked the <span style="color:darkgreen;">Export</span> link, a *.csv* file was saved on your computer.

* Now that the file is on your computer, we need to <span style="color:darkgreen;">upload</span> it into RStudio.

###**Uploading**
* <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Look at the four different *panes* in RStudio.**</span>

    – <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Find the *pane* with a</span> <span style="color:darkgreen;">Files</span> <span style="color:midnightblue;">tab.**</span>

    – <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Click it!**</span>

    <img src="../../img/1xc0d.png" style="width:400px;height:110px;"/>

* <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Click the button on the Files pane that says "Upload".**</span>

    – <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Click on "Choose File" and find the *SurveyResponses.csv* file you saved to your computer.**</span>

    – <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Hit the *OK* button.**</span>

* Voila!

    – If you look in the <span style="color:darkgreen;">Files</span> pane, you should be able to find your data!

###**Upload vs. Import**
* By <span style="color:darkgreen;">Uploading</span> your data into RStudio you've really only given yourself access to it.

    – Don't believe me? Look at the <span style="color:darkgreen;">Environment</span> pane ... where's your data?

* To actually use the data we need to <span style="color:darkgreen;">Import</span> it into your computer's memory.

* To compute more quickly and efficiently, ```R``` will only keep a few datasets stored in its memory at a time.

    – By importing data, you are telling ```R``` that this is a dataset that is important to store it in its memory so you can use it.

###**Importing**

<img src="../../img/1xc0e.png" style="width:400px;height:275px;"/>

* <span style="color:midnightblue;">**On the Files pane, find the data you want to</span> <span style="color:darkgreen;">import</span><span style="color:midnightblue;">.**</span>

* <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Click on the name of the file and choose the option "Import Dataset..."**</span>

###**Data Preview**

<img src="../../img/1xc0ee.png" style="width:400px;height:275px;"/>

* You can give your data a name using the <span style="color:darkgreen;">Name:</span> field in the lower left corner.

###**What's in a name?**
* The name you give your data is what you will use when you write code to analyze your data.

    – Good names are short and descriptive.

    – For your Food Habits campaign, some good names to use would be "foodhabits" or even just "food".

* When you're ready, click the *Import* button.

* Make sure the name under Import Options matches the name in the Code Preview before you click Import.

<img src="../../img/lab1c_slide12ex.png" style="width:867px;height:100px;"/>

###**read.csv()**

* After you click *Import* you might notice something appeared in your console.

        data.file <- read_csv("~/SurveyResponse.csv")
        View(data.file)

* This is the actual code ```RStudio``` uses to read your data when you clicked the *Import* button.

    – So instead of using the ```RStudio``` buttons, we can actually <span style="color:darkgreen;">Import</span> by writing code similar to what was output into the console!

    – This will come in handy later in the course.

###**A word on staying organized...**

<img src="../../img/lab1c_slide14.png" style="width:400px;height:110px;"/>

* The <span style="color:darkgreen;">Files</span> tab has a few other features to help keep you organized.

    – *CampaignName - Ids Teacher Year Semester* probably isn't the best name for your data. Click <span style="color:darkgreen;">Rename</span> to give it a clearer name.

    – Often, it’s helpful to give your data file the same name as when you import your data.

    – So in this case, we could name our data file *food.csv*.

###**Analysis Time**

* After you <span style="color:darkgreen;">Export</span>, <span style="color:darkgreen;">Upload</span>, <span style="color:darkgreen;">Import</span> your data, you're ready to analyze.

* <span style="color:firebrick;">**(1) ```View``` your data and select a variable. Write and run code to create an appropriate plot for that variable.**</span>

* <span style="color:firebrick;">**(2) What variable did you choose? What does the plot tell us about that variable?**</span>

* <span style="color:firebrick;">**Summarize the process:**</span>

    – <span style="color:firebrick;">**(3) What might your future self forget about this process? Summarize the steps you took in this lab to use new data in RStudio.**</span>
