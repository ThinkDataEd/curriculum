##**<u>Lesson 14: Variables, Variables, Variables</u>**

###**Objective:**
Students will learn how to read and interpret multiple variable plots: bivariate scatterplots, multiple
variable scatterplots, stacked bar plots, and side-by-side bar plots. They will summarize their learning
about multiple variable plots using a four-fold graphic organizer.

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    To examine whether two (or more) variables are related, we can plot their
    distributions on the same graph.

###**Lesson:**

1. Begin by informing students that they will learn how to make visual displays using more than one
variable, and by asking them to ponder the following questions:

    100. What do you think is the relation between people’s heights and weights?

    100. Are taller people heavier? Always? Or is this just a tendency?

    What do you think is the relation between people's heights and weights? Are taller people
    heavier? Always? Or is this just a tendency?

    Let's look at some data.

2. Display the following plot to the class ([LMR_U1_L14_A](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_6.0/LMR_U1_L14_A.pdf)) so they can see some actual data:

    100. What kind of plot is this and how will you remember its features? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Scatterplot. Answers will vary about how students will remember its features.***</span>

    100. How many variables are displayed in this plot? Name the variable(s) and identify the type
    of variable(s). <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Two variables. Weight in kilograms and height in meters. Numerical
    variables.***</span>

    100. What do the axes show? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: The x-axis shows the height of teens in meters, and the y-axis
    shows the weight of teens in kilograms.***</span>

    100. Do taller people weigh more? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Not necessarily, but there is a tendency for this to be
    true.***</span>

4. Discuss this plot with the class by eliciting students’ responses to the questions. Students actively
listen to the discussion by confirming, correcting, or adding to their own responses.

5. Close the discussion by asking students: What questions might you have about this plot? What
additional information would be helpful?

6. Now, suppose we could see which of these dots represented girls and which represented boys.
Where do you think most of the girls' dots would be relative to the boys?

    100. What do the axes show? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: The x-axis shows the height of teens in meters, and the y-axis
    shows the weight of teens in kilograms.***</span>

    100. What questions can we ask that this graph might answer? <span style="color:grey">***Possible questions are: Who is taller, boys or girls?
    Who weighs more? Is the association between height and weight the same for
    boys as it is for girls?***</span>

9. Discuss this plot with the class by eliciting students’ responses to the questions. Students actively
