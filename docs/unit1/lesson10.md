##**<u>Lesson 10: Making Histograms</u>**

###**Objective:**
Students will understand that a histogram represents observations grouped into bins, and that bars are
drawn to show how many observations (or what proportion of the observations) lie in each bin, rather than
representing individual observations, as in a dotplot.

###**Materials:**
1. Peanut butter

2. Jelly

3. Loaf of sliced bread

4. Butter knife

5. Plate

6. *Sleep* dotplots (from [Lesson 9](lesson9.md))

7. Poster paper

8. Markers

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts:"
    Histograms can be created through the use of an algorithm. The distributions
    displayed in a histogram can be classified using the technical terms for the shapes of distributions.
    Learning to describe routine tasks through an algorithm is an important component of computational
    thinking.

###**Lesson:**

1. Inform students that they will be telling us how to make a sandwich today. Giving clear, concise
instructions to others is an important skill for students to learn. In this activity, students will
practice using descriptive vocabulary, communicating ideas to others, recognizing steps in a
process, and recognizing the importance of the use of clear language.

2. Prepare for this task by gathering the necessary materials for making a peanut butter and jelly
sandwich and arranging them in a way that makes them easy to use. You may want to wear an
apron and have a trash bag smock — this can get messy but that’s most of the fun!

    **<u>Note:</u> Be aware of peanut allergies!** If any of your students are allergic to peanut butter, DO
    NOT ALLOW STUDENTS TO HANDLE THE PEANUT BUTTER! Peanut allergies can be very
    serious and children can have reactions without even eating it. So be aware and be careful!

3. Ask your students if they have ever followed a recipe before.

    100. What kinds of things have they made?

    100. Does anyone know how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?

    100. Would they teach you how?

    100. Would they give you all the steps to make a sandwich?

4. Show your students the materials you have for making a sandwich. Have students take out paper
and pencils and ask each student (or pair of students) to write down their instructions for making
a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. We can also call these instructions an **algorithm**.

5. Explain to students that precise instructions for any process are like a formula to follow in order to
get the same results each time. Also, an algorithm is how we communicate with the computer.
The teacher will function as the computer. Your job is to give him/her rules so that he/she can
carry out and successfully make a PB&J sandwich.

6. Every algorithm needs input and produces output. The output here will be a PB&J sandwich.
What is the input? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Steps, or actions to follow.***</span>

7. Tell students that when they are done you will select someone to share their instructions and you
will make a sandwich following the instructions.

8. Select a student to read their instructions, and do EXACTLY what it says. For example, if it says
“put the peanut butter on the bread,” you can literally put the jar of peanut butter on the bag of
bread. There was no instruction to open the bread or the jar of peanut butter, no instruction to use
the knife in any way, etc. Listen for other examples of unclear instructions and think of how you
might act them out. If students are not clear about where to spread the peanut butter, put it on the
crust. The more literal you are by doing exactly what the instructions say, the funnier the activity
will be and the more likely you are to get your point across about the importance of clear
instructions.

9. After your first sandwich, ask your students if they think their instructions were clear or not. What
are some things they might have done differently?

10. Select another student to read his/her instructions. They will be sure to use clarifications of the
instructions you acted upon before - this is a good thing!

11. After you finish the sandwich, ask your students if they think clear instructions are important.
Why?

12. Let students know that they will now develop an algorithm for building a histogram to represent
the sleep dotplots they created in the previous lesson.

13. Explain that a **histogram**, rather than showing the frequency for each value, shows the frequency
(or percent, but we will focus on frequency) of all the values that fall in a certain range, called a
**bin**. For example, we might choose bins that go from 0-5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-20, 20-25. ***Bin widths***
<span style="color:grey">***will vary by class.***</span>

14. Model how to create a histogram using the data from the dotplot “hours of sleep last night”. On a
blank chart, create the x-axis with bin widths 0-3, 3-6, 6-9, etc. and place marks on the plot at
those intervals and ask students: “What are the frequencies in each bin?”

    Notice that multiples of three appear in more than one bin. Let’s take the value of 6 hours as an
    example. Should those observations be included in the second bin (3-6) or the third bin (6-9)?

    * If students include the values of 6 hours in the second bin then they are using the
        **left-hand rule**.

    * If students include the values of 6 hours in the third bin then they are using the
        **right-hand rule**.

15. Once the frequencies have been determined, draw the bars with corresponding heights. Do not
include spaces between the bars as time is a continuous variable.

16. Next, student teams will create an algorithm that gives directions for how to construct a histogram
for the data from the dotplot for “hours of sleep they hope to get on Saturday.” Remember, an
algorithm is a set of rules that can always be applied. Similar to the way they wrote a process for
making a PB&J sandwich, students will write a process for creating a histogram. Tell students to
continue thinking of the process to transform the data in the dotplot to create a histogram. The
algorithm will produce an **output**, which will be a histogram. What's the **input**? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Data, or maybe
the dotplot.***</span>

17. Inform the students that you will provide a piece of input: how wide the bin will be. For instance, it
might be 5 hours, it might be 1 hour, or it might be 10 hours (or half an hour!). Whatever it is, their
algorithm should work for any input value.

18. Let students work for a bit. They should write out Step 1, Step 2, etc. Then choose a group and
ask them to get you started. Give them a bin width of 4.

19. Teachers should sketch the histogram on the board or chart paper as students read their
algorithms. Again, teachers should take things very literally. For example, if they do not tell you
exactly where the bins should start, start one way off to the left. If they are vague and say "divide
the number line into groups of 10,” then make them arbitrary sizes. If they have to be the same
size, ask them how to do that. Points to consider:

    100. Where do we start drawing the bins? Always at the location of the smallest dotplot?
    Always at the greatest? A little to the left?

    100. What do we do with points that fall exactly on a boundary? Do they go to the bin on the
    left or on the right? Does it matter? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: No, it doesn't matter as long as they're consistent (all in the left or all in the right).***</span>

    100. Can we do it differently every time? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: No. We need to be consistent. This is called
    either the left-hand rule or the right-hand rule, depending on which is chosen.***</span>

20. After following 2 or 3 algorithms, ask students if they feel their algorithm is precise enough. Allow
students time to revise their algorithms.

21. Have a class discussion about the similarities and differences between the original dotplot and a
histogram. Ask:

    100. What have we gained from the histogram? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: We now can see the shape of the
    distribution as a whole.***</span>

    100. What have we lost? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: We lost each individual observation by grouping them into bins.***</span>

###**Class Scribes:**
One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics
of the day were.

Students should continue to collect nutritional facts data using the *Food Habits* Participatory Sensing
campaign on their smart devices or via web browser.
