##**<u>Lesson 11: What Shape Are You In?</u>**

###**Objective:**
Students will learn to classify distributions in terms of shape, and can suggest theories for why a
distribution might be one shape or another.

###**Materials:**
1. *Sorting Histograms* handout ([LMR_U1_L11](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_6.0/LMR_U1_L11.pdf)) - one copy per group of 4 students.
(This activity comes from the AIMS project, University of Minnesota, J. Garfield.)<br>
    **<u>Advance preparation required:</u>** Needs to be cut into sets (see step 1 in lesson)

###**Vocabulary:**

[symmetric](../../vocabulary/unit1/#symmetric "a type of distribution where the left side of the distribution mirrors the right side"){ .md-button }
[left-skewed](../../vocabulary/unit1/#left-skewed "the mean is typically less than the median; the tail of the distribution is longer on the left-hand side than on the right-hand side"){ .md-button }
[right-skewed](../../vocabulary/unit1/#right-skewed "the mean is typically greater than the median; the tail of the distribution is longer on the right-hand side than on the left-hand side"){ .md-button }
[unimodal](../../vocabulary/unit1/#unimodal "a distribution which has a single peak"){ .md-button }
[bimodal](../../vocabulary/unit1/#bimodal "a distribution which has two peaks"){ .md-button }

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts:"
    Identifying the shape of a histogram is part of the **interpret** step of the Data Cycle.

###**Lesson:**

1. Distribute the cutouts from the *Sorting Histograms* handout ([LMR_U1_L11](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_6.0/LMR_U1_L11.pdf)). Give each student team
all of the 24 histograms (can be paper clipped together or put in small zippered bags).

    **<u>Advance preparation required:</u>** Print the *Sorting Histogram*s file ([LMR_U1_L11](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_6.0/LMR_U1_L11.pdf)). Cut each
    histogram so that it is on its own piece of paper. Create enough sets for each team to have all 24
    histograms. They can be paper clipped together, or put in small zippered bags.

2. Inform students that the type of data being measured is indicated on the horizontal axis, and the
vertical axis represents how many observations are in each bar.

3. The students will then sort their stack of plots into different piles according to their shapes.
Histograms that have similar shapes should be sorted into the same stack.

4. Once the student teams have agreed upon the histogram shape groupings, they should discuss
and write down answers to the following in their DS journals:

    100. Describe whatâ€™s similar about the plots in each group. <span style="color:grey">***Answers will vary but should be
    grouped by the overall shape of the distribution. For example, plots with a higher
    density of bars on the right side of the plot should all be in the same group.***</span>

    100. Pick one graph in each group that is the best example of that group. <span style="color:grey">***Answers will vary.***</span>

    100. Give the group a name that you think describes the general shape. <span style="color:grey">***Answers will vary.***</span>

    100. If there are graphs that do not fit into any group, try to determine why it was impossible to
    place them. What is different or confusing about them? <span style="color:grey">***Answers will vary.***</span>

5. After each team has had time to discuss and write down their observations, have a class
discussion about the histogram groupings. Do the students agree about the general shapes?

6. In statistics, we use specific terminology when discussing the shapes of distributions, such as
**symmetric**, **right-skewed**, **left-skewed**, **unimodal**, **bimodal**, etc. Did any of the teams use
these terms? If not, introduce each one and ask which of the 24 histograms could be classified as
that shape.

7. Next, introduce the following scenarios and ask students to determine what a corresponding
histogram might look like. They should use statistical terms to describe their answer.

    100. The grades on an easy test. <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Left-skewed, unimodal.***</span>

    100. The grades on a difficult test. <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Right-skewed, unimodal.***</span>

    100. The number of times IDS students study during the first week of class. <span style="color:grey">***Answers will
    vary.***</span>

    100. The age of cars on a used car lot. <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Right-skewed, probably unimodal.***</span>

    100. The amount of time spent by students on a difficult test (max time allowed is 50 mins).
    <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Left-skewed, but may also just be one bar with all observations at 50 mins,
    unimodal.***</span>

    100. The heights of students in your high school band. <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Symmetric, bimodal.***</span>

    100. The salaries of all persons employed at the Los Angeles Unified School District. <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Right-skewed,
    potentially bimodal (teachers vs. administrators).***</span>

###**Class Scribes:**
One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics
of the day were.

Students should continue to collect nutritional facts data using the *Food Habits* Participatory Sensing
campaign on their smart devices or via web browser.
