##**<u>Lesson 6: What Do I Eat?</u>**

###**Objective:**
Students will collect data using paper and pencil to understand the challenges of organizing, storing, and
sharing data. They will learn that there must be an agreement about the variables that need to be
recorded in order to attain consistency.

###**Materials:**
1. Video: Jamie Oliver’s *Food Revolution* found at:<br>
    [https://youtu.be/I0vYwqkoktM](https://youtu.be/I0vYwqkoktM "https://youtu.be/I0vYwqkoktM"){:target="_blank"}

    **<u>Note:</u>** If the video is unavailable, search for "Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution What's In a
    Sundae". The video should be 5-6 minutes in length.

2. Nutrition Facts labels or pictures (collected previously by students)

    **<u>Note:</u>** If needed, use *Nutrition Facts Cutouts* handout ([LMR_U1_L6_A](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_6.0/LMR_U1_L6_A.pdf))

3. *Food Habits Data Collection* handout ([LMR_U1_L6_B](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_6.0/LMR_U1_L6_B.pdf))

###**Vocabulary:**
[dataset(s)](../../vocabulary/unit1/#data set(s) "a collection of data"){ .md-button }

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts:"
    After raising statistical investigative questions, we examine and record data to see if the
    questions are appropriate.

###**Lesson:**
1. Inform students that today’s lesson will focus on the Data Collection component of the Data Cycle.

2. To motivate this, the students will watch a short video of an episode of Jamie Oliver’s show titled
*Food Revolution* found at: [https://youtu.be/I0vYwqkoktM](https://youtu.be/I0vYwqkoktM "https://youtu.be/I0vYwqkoktM"){:target="_blank"}. This particular video was recorded at a
Los Angeles high school.

    100. As the students watch the video, they should use their DS journals to write down their
    comments and/or reactions to what they see and hear and be ready to share out.

    100. After sharing out some of their responses, have the students respond to the following
    question in their DS journals: **Why should I care about what I eat?**

    100. Student teams will share their reactions and responses by engaging in a Silent
    Discussion (see [Instructional Strategies](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/4_IDS_Teacher Resources_v_5.0/TR_Instructional Strategies.pdf) in [Teacher Resources](../download/resources.md)).

3. Have students recall the *Stick Figures* activity from [Lesson 2](lesson2.md). During that activity, they collected
data about other people. But today, they are going to be collecting data about themselves and the
foods they eat.

4. Students should have Nutrition Facts labels available from food/snacks they consumed at home between the previous lesson and today. <br> **<u>Note:**</u> If some students forgot to bring any, then you can pass out some of the *Nutrition Facts Cutouts* ([LMR_U1_L6_A](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_6.0/LMR_U1_L6_A.pdf)) for them to use instead.

    <div align="right"><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https://curriculum.thinkdataed.org/IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_6.0/LMR_U1_L6_A.pdf&embedded=true" style=" width:420px;height:400px;" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>[LMR_U1_L6_A](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_6.0/LMR_U1_L6_A.pdf)</div>

5. For 3-5 minutes, allow students to collect any data they can from the label and record it in their
DS journals. This should be done individually.

6. Once they have collected their facts, ask students to compare and contrast their data with their
team members. They need to respond to:

    100. How are their **datasets** similar?

    100. How are their **datasets** different?

7. Gather the students as a whole group and ask them to share out the similarities and differences
they discussed. Be sure to draw responses that show that while some facts collected were the
same, there were others that were collected by some students and not by others. Also point to
differences in the variables collected and the data structure used.

    100. Ask students to engage in the following individual Quickwrite (see [Instructional Strategies](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/4_IDS_Teacher Resources_v_5.0/TR_Instructional Strategies.pdf)
    in [Teacher Resources](../download/resources.md)): How can the data you just gathered be quickly displayed and
    easily read? 

    100. Distribute the *Food Habits Data Collection* handout ([LMR_U1_L6_B](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_6.0/LMR_U1_L6_B.pdf)). They can use their own label for the first observation, and then fill out the rest of the table with the food/snacks they consume during the Food Habits campaign.

8. Once they are finished, in pairs, ask students to give a one-word identifier to each variable. For
example: “What’s the name of your snack?” = Name

9. Share the one-word variable identifiers with the class by conducting a quick team Whip Around
(see [Instructional Strategies](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/4_IDS_Teacher Resources_v_5.0/TR_Instructional Strategies.pdf) in [Teacher Resources](../download/resources.md)).

10. For homework, students will begin to formulate statistical investigative questions based on their *Food Habits*
data.

11. Inform students that they are permitted to bring mobile devices to the next class.

###**Class Scribes:**
One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics
of the day were.

###<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Homework**</p>
Ask students to examine the data in their *Food Habits Data Collection* handout ([LMR_U1_L6_B](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_6.0/LMR_U1_L6_B.pdf)) and to
generate three statistical investigative questions (summary, comparison, association) that they think can be answered by the Food Habits data.

Students may bring their mobile devices to the next class for data collection purposes.
