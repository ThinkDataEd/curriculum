    "body": "This document outlines the `Introduction to Data Science Curriculum v_5.0` project, hosted at `curriculum.thinkdataed.org`. It details the necessary `MkDocs` commands for building, serving, and deploying the documentation site, along with an overview of the project's file structure. Furthermore, it provides a step-by-step workflow for managers, covering the setup of development tools like Visual Studio Code and GitHub Desktop, and the processes for updating, previewing, and publishing changes to both the website and its source code. The project's source code is maintained in the `IDSUCLA/curriculum` repository on GitHub, which is accessible at `https://github.com/IDSUCLA/curriculum`."

    "title": "Overview of the Introduction to Data Science Curriculum and MkDocs Deployment",
    "body": "The `curriculum.thinkdataed.org` website hosts the `Introduction to Data Science Curriculum v_5.0`. This curriculum's documentation site is built and managed using `MkDocs`. `MkDocs` commands are essential for site maintenance, including `mkdocs build` to generate the static website, `mkdocs serve` to run a local live-reloading server for previewing changes, and `mkdocs gh-deploy` to publish the site to `curriculum.thinkdataed.org`. For full documentation and support related to `MkDocs`, users can visit `mkdocs.org`. The project's source code is openly available and managed in the `IDSUCLA/curriculum` GitHub repository, found at `https://github.com/IDSUCLA/curriculum`."

    "title": "Essential MkDocs Commands for Curriculum Site Development",
    "body": "To manage the `Introduction to Data Science Curriculum v_5.0` documentation site, several core `MkDocs` commands are utilized. The `mkdocs build` command is used to compile the source Markdown files into a static website, preparing it for deployment. For real-time previewing of edits, `mkdocs serve` starts a local server that automatically reloads changes, allowing developers to see updates instantly. To publish the updated website to its live URL, `curriculum.thinkdataed.org`, the `mkdocs gh-deploy` command is executed. Alternatively, these commands can be invoked using `python3 -m mkdocs [command]`. For general assistance, `mkdocs -h` provides help information, and the official documentation for `MkDocs` is available at `mkdocs.org`."

    "title": "Understanding the File Layout of the Data Science Curriculum Project",
    "body": "The `Introduction to Data Science Curriculum v_5.0` project, which powers `curriculum.thinkdataed.org`, has a defined file layout for its `MkDocs` documentation. The `mkdocs.yml` file serves as the main configuration file for the entire site, controlling its structure and settings. All source content, including individual Markdown pages (`XX.md` for lessons), images, and other necessary files, resides within the `docs/` folder. Specifically, PDF files intended for download and preview are stored under `docs/IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/`. After `MkDocs` successfully builds the documentation using commands like `mkdocs build`, the generated static website files are compiled and placed into the `site/` directory, ready for deployment."

    "title": "Manager's Setup Guide for Curriculum Development Environment",
    "body": "For managers involved in updating the `Introduction to Data Science Curriculum v_5.0` content on `curriculum.thinkdataed.org`, the initial setup involves installing key development tools. Visual Studio Code, which can be downloaded from `https://code.visualstudio.com/`, and GitHub Desktop are required. IDS Tech will be responsible for the configuration of these tools. Once installed, managers need to start GitHub Desktop and ensure they are working with the correct repository by switching the 'Current Repository' to `IDSUCLA/curriculum` (or simply `curriculum`). It's crucial to then select the `master` branch. To ensure the local repository is up-to-date with the `https://github.com/IDSUCLA/curriculum` remote, users should click the 'Refresh Icon/Fetch Origin' and then 'Pull Origin' if updates are available, before making any changes."

  {
    "title": "Workflow for Editing and Local Preview of Curriculum Content",
    "body": "After the initial setup and ensuring the local repository for `Introduction to Data Science Curriculum v_5.0` is synchronized, managers can proceed with making and previewing changes to the `curriculum.thinkdataed.org` content. The process begins by opening the project folder, typically located at `Documents/Github/Curriculum`, in Visual Studio Code. A new terminal should be opened within VS Code, where `git pull` can be executed to synchronize the local source code with the `master` branch of the `IDSUCLA/curriculum` repository (serving as an alternative to using GitHub Desktop's pull function). Following any file edits, `mkdocs serve` is run in the terminal to start a live-reloading local server, allowing the manager to view their changes instantly in a web browser before publishing them."

  {
    "title": "Publishing Updates to the Curriculum Website and Source Code",
    "body": "Once changes to the `Introduction to Data Science Curriculum v_5.0` have been made and thoroughly previewed locally using `mkdocs serve`, the next critical step is to publish them to the live environment. To deploy the updated documentation website to `curriculum.thinkdataed.org`, the `mkdocs gh-deploy` command is executed in the Visual Studio Code terminal. This command pushes the generated static site files to the live server. Subsequently, to publish the updated source code (the Markdown files and other assets) to the `master` branch of the `IDSUCLA/curriculum` GitHub repository, `git push` is performed in the terminal. Alternatively, managers can use GitHub Desktop to commit their changes and then 'Push' them to the repository, ensuring the source code at `https://github.com/IDSUCLA/curriculum` is synchronized with the live content."

  {
    "title": "Managing the Curriculum Source Code via GitHub Repository",
    "body": "The `Introduction to Data Science Curriculum v_5.0` source code, which underpins the `curriculum.thinkdataed.org` website, is centrally managed on GitHub. The specific repository for this project is `IDSUCLA/curriculum`, accessible at `https://github.com/IDSUCLA/curriculum`. For managers, this involves regularly interacting with the repository to keep their local development environment synchronized and to publish their contributions. Through GitHub Desktop, users can easily switch to the `IDSUCLA/curriculum` repository, select the `master` branch, and perform `Fetch Origin` and `Pull Origin` operations to retrieve the latest updates. After making changes and local testing, `git push` in Visual Studio Code's terminal or the 'Commit -> Push' workflow in GitHub Desktop is used to publish the updated source code back to the `master` branch of the repository, making it available to others and for deployment processes."
