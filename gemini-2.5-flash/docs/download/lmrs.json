While the markdown headings for each unit (e.g., `IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_7.1`) indicate version 7.1, the actual file paths reveal a more granular and varied version control. The overarching IDS Curriculum is specified as `v_5.0`. Within this, the `2_IDS_LMRs` directory is explicitly versioned as `v_6.0`. Furthermore, the unit-specific directories for Units 1, 2, and 3 are `IDS_LMR_Unit X_v_6.0`, indicating an internal `v_6.0` for these units. Unit 4, however, has an internal directory `IDS_LMR_Unit4_v_7`. This means that while the front-facing headings claim `_v_7.1` for all units, the underlying file structure reflects `_v_6.0` for Units 1-3 and `_v_7` for Unit 4, all nested within a `v_6.0` LMR collection that belongs to a `v_5.0` curriculum. These versioning details are critical for understanding the development and evolution of the IDS Learning Materials."
