    "title": "Abstract: Overview of IDS Lab Response Sheets",
    "body": "This document serves as a comprehensive index for the IDS Lab Response Sheets, which are essential components of the IDS Curriculum v_5.0. The lab sheets are organized into four distinct units: Unit 1, Unit 2, Unit 3, and Unit 4. Each unit contains a series of individual labs, identified by a specific naming convention, such as LRS_XA.pdf, where 'X' denotes the unit number and 'A' represents a sequential lab within that unit. The lab sheets themselves are marked as version 7.1 and are located within a structured directory path, specifically under the `3_IDS_Lab Response Sheets_v_5.0` folder, further organized into `IDS_Lab_Sheets_UnitX_v_7` subdirectories for each respective unit. The original source document for this index is found at `.\\docs\\download\\labs.md`. This collection provides detailed response sheets for practical lab exercises, supporting the IDS curriculum."

    "title": "Introduction to IDS Lab Response Sheets Collection",
    "body": "This collection provides access to the IDS Lab Response Sheets, an integral part of the broader IDS Curriculum, specifically version 5.0. These sheets are designed to accompany practical laboratory exercises across multiple units of study. The original indexing document for these lab sheets is located at `.\\docs\\download\\labs.md`. The sheets are categorically grouped by units, spanning from Unit 1 through Unit 4, ensuring a structured approach to the learning process. Each individual lab response sheet is a PDF document, accessible via a standardized file path that reflects its unit and version within the curriculum's directory structure, for example, `../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/3_IDS_Lab Response Sheets_v_5.0/IDS_Lab_Sheets_UnitX_v_7/LRS_XN.pdf`. This organized system facilitates easy navigation and retrieval of specific lab materials."

    "title": "Versioning and Naming Conventions for IDS Lab Response Sheets",
    "body": "The IDS Lab Response Sheets follow a clear versioning and naming convention within the IDS Curriculum v_5.0. Each set of lab sheets for a unit is specified as version 7.1, as indicated by headings like \"Lab Sheets_Unit X_v_7.1\". These sheets are stored in corresponding directories named `IDS_Lab_Sheets_UnitX_v_7`. Individual lab files are named using the pattern \"LRS_XN.pdf\", where 'LRS' stands for Lab Response Sheet, 'X' denotes the specific unit number (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 4), and 'N' is an alphabetical character (e.g., A, B, C) that uniquely identifies a lab within that unit. All these PDF files are situated under the `3_IDS_Lab Response Sheets_v_5.0` folder, which is part of the larger `IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0` structure. This systematic approach ensures consistency and ease of identification for all lab materials."
