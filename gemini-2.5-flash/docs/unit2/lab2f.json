    "body": "This lab, Unit 2 Lab 2F, titled \"The Titanic Shuffle,\" extends previous learning on random data shuffling to numerical variables using statistical summaries. The primary objective is to investigate whether passengers who survived the Titanic disaster paid a higher fare than those who did not. The lab involves loading and visualizing the `titanic` dataset, initially exploring fare distributions through boxplots. Students will then apply `do`-loops and the `shuffle` function to randomly reassign survival statuses 500 times, calculating the median fare difference between simulated survivor and non-survivor groups. This process helps determine if observed differences are due to chance. The lab concludes with a statistical analysis of the shuffled median fare data to answer the research question. Furthermore, it explores the impact of using mean fares instead of median fares, requiring students to repeat the shuffling and difference calculation process, and evaluate if the conclusion regarding fare and survival changes based on the chosen numerical summary. This hands-on exercise emphasizes the importance of simulation in statistical inference."

    "title": "Introduction to Unit 2 Lab 2F: The Titanic Shuffle",
    "body": "This document outlines Unit 2 Lab 2F, \"The Titanic Shuffle,\" which serves as a continuation of concepts introduced in previous labs. Building upon the understanding of `do`-loops and the `shuffle` function for simulating random data permutations, this lab applies these techniques to numerical variables. The core investigation revolves around the question: \"Is there any evidence to suggest that those who survived paid a higher fare than those who died?\" Participants will use random shuffling and numerical summaries to explore this hypothesis, extending their analytical skills to complex datasets. The lab leverages the historical `titanic` passenger and survival data, which details the ill-fated voyage of the \"unsinkable\" ship that sank in 1912 after hitting an iceberg."

    "title": "Initial Data Exploration and Hypothesis for Fare and Survival on the Titanic",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lab 2F, \"The Titanic Shuffle,\" begins by engaging with the historical `titanic` passenger and survival data. This dataset documents the catastrophic sinking of the Titanic in 1912, a vessel famously, yet incorrectly, proclaimed \"unsinkable.\" To initiate the investigation into whether survivors paid higher fares, students are instructed to first load the `titanic` data using the `data()` function. Subsequently, they will create a boxplot visualizing the distribution of `fare`s paid by passengers, faceted by their `survival` status. This visual exploration is critical for forming an initial hypothesis: \"Do you believe that passengers who paid a higher fare on the Titanic were more likely to survive?\" The lab further prompts students to describe the distribution of fares paid, identify a preferred numerical summary for the 'typical' value, and calculate the typical fare for both survivors and non-survivors."

    "title": "Simulating Differences with Random Shuffling Using Median Fares",
    "body": "Building on prior knowledge of `do`-loops and the `shuffle` function, Unit 2 Lab 2F, \"The Titanic Shuffle,\" focuses on simulating random permutations to assess the likelihood of observed differences being due to chance. Specifically for numerical variables, the lab guides students to apply these techniques to the `titanic` dataset. A central step involves shuffling the passengers' survival status 500 times using the `do` and `shuffle` functions. For each of these 500 shuffles, the median fare paid by each group (simulated survivors and non-survivors) is computed. The resulting shuffled data, which includes these median fares, is then assigned the name `shuffled_survival`. Subsequently, the `mutate` function is used to create a new variable, `diff`, representing the difference between the median fare of simulated survivors and non-survivors, further processing the `shuffled_survival` dataset. This iterative simulation is crucial for understanding the variability of fare differences under a null hypothesis."

    "title": "Analyzing Shuffled Median Fares and Drawing Conclusions for Unit 2 Lab 2F",
    "body": "Following the simulation of 500 shuffled survival statuses and the calculation of median fare differences in Unit 2 Lab 2F, \"The Titanic Shuffle,\" the next critical phase is to analyze this `shuffled_survival` data. The primary goal is to answer the lab's central research question: \"Is there any evidence to suggest that those who survived paid a higher fare than those who died?\" Students are tasked with formulating their answer as a comprehensive statistical analysis. This analysis requires the creation of a plot based on the shuffled data, along with a detailed explanation of how this plot supports their conclusion regarding the observed fare differences. A vital component of this write-up is to elucidate the importance of shuffling the data in the first place, highlighting its role in establishing whether an observed difference is statistically significant or merely a product of random variation. This step reinforces the core statistical inference concepts of the lab."

    "title": "Advanced Shuffling: Comparing Mean Fares and Methodological Impact in Unit 2 Lab 2F",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lab 2F, \"The Titanic Shuffle,\" extends its statistical inquiry beyond median fares by posing a new challenge: \"What about if instead of calculating the median fare price for each group after a shuffle, we calculated the mean fare price and took the difference (mean_survivor – mean_victim)?\" This prompts students to predict the distribution of these differences if repeated 500 times. Subsequently, they are instructed to execute this alternative simulation: using `do` and `shuffle` functions to shuffle passenger survival status 500 times, computing the mean fare paid for each group in every shuffle. Following this, the `mutate` function is applied to create a `diff` variable, representing the mean fare of survivors minus the mean fare of non-survivors. The final task is to evaluate what this shuffled data reveals and critically assess if the answer to the main research question changes when using mean fares instead of median fares, thus exploring the robustness of conclusions across different numerical summaries."

    "title": "Reinforcing the Statistical Inquiry: The Titanic Shuffle's Core Question and Simulation",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lab 2F, \"The Titanic Shuffle,\" centers on a compelling research question: \"Is there any evidence to suggest that those who survived paid a higher fare than those who died?\" To address this, the lab employs a robust simulation methodology, building upon the foundational `do`-loop and `shuffle` functions previously learned. This approach is crucial for analyzing numerical variables, like passenger `fare`, and determining if observed differences between groups are likely due to chance. The core of the lab involves repeatedly shuffling passengers' survival statuses—500 times in both the median and mean fare investigations—and calculating key numerical summaries (median or mean) for the resulting groups. By simulating many possible random arrangements, students can understand the distribution of differences expected under random chance, providing a benchmark against which the actual observed difference in fares can be compared. This iterative process is fundamental to the statistical analysis performed within the lab."

    "title": "Practical Application and Interpretation of Shuffling Results in Unit 2 Lab 2F",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lab 2F, \"The Titanic Shuffle,\" provides practical experience in statistical analysis, starting with essential data handling. Students are guided to load the `titanic` dataset using the `data()` function and visualize the `fare` distribution, specifically creating a boxplot faceted by `survival` status. This initial visualization is key to forming an intuitive understanding and preliminary hypothesis. The lab then delves into the practical implementation of shuffling: using `do` and `shuffle` functions to simulate 500 random reassignments of survival status. For each simulation, numerical summaries—initially median fares, then mean fares—are computed for the groups, and their differences are calculated using the `mutate` function. This hands-on process culminates in interpreting the simulated distributions of these differences. The final step requires students to articulate a comprehensive statistical analysis, presenting a plot derived from their shuffled data and clearly explaining how it supports their conclusion regarding the relationship between fare paid and survival on the Titanic, emphasizing the critical role of randomization in drawing valid inferences."
