    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 10, titled 'Marbles, Marbles...', explores the variability of random events and the concept that observed percentages from samples may not precisely match predicted probabilities. Students will learn to convert percentages to proportions and investigate different methods of sampling data, specifically 'with replacement' and 'without replacement'. Through a hands-on activity, student teams use 50 marbles (comprising 20 of one color and 30 of another) to conduct multiple draws. This simulation, performed first with 10 draws and then expanded to 50 draws, demonstrates the crucial principle that larger sample sizes lead to sample proportions that more accurately reflect the 'true' underlying probability. The lesson also defines essential vocabulary, including proportion, percentage, event, 'with replacement', and 'without replacement', and prepares students for creating their own simulations in Unit 2 Lab 2C."

    "title": "Introduction to Random Events and Simulations (Unit 2 Lesson 10)",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 10, 'Marbles, Marbles...', builds upon previous lessons by diving deeper into understanding random events and how their outcomes vary. Students will explore why the percentage predicted by a probability is often not exact in practice. Recalling their work in Unit 2 Lesson 8, where the `rflip()` function simulated coin flips, and Unit 2 Lesson 9, which used the `roll_die()` function for dice rolls, this lesson prepares students for situations where pre-packaged functions aren't available. A core objective of Unit 2 Lesson 10 is to introduce the idea of creating simulations from scratch, a skill that will be further developed in Unit 2 Lab 2C. This approach helps students grasp the foundational concepts of probability and sampling in a more hands-on manner."

    "title": "Objectives and Materials for Unit 2 Lesson 10",
    "body": "The primary objective of Unit 2 Lesson 10, 'Marbles, Marbles...', is for students to comprehend that random events naturally exhibit variation, meaning the percentage derived from a probability prediction is not always exact in every instance. A secondary objective involves practicing the conversion of percentages into proportions. To facilitate this hands-on learning experience, each student team will be provided with 50 marbles. Specifically, these marbles will consist of 20 of one distinct color and 30 of another color. A practical note states that if marbles are unavailable, other similarly sized materials, such as small blocks, can serve as suitable substitutes. This setup allows for tangible exploration of probability concepts, leading into discussions about sampling techniques and the impact of sample size."

    "title": "Key Vocabulary and Essential Concepts in Unit 2 Lesson 10",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 10, 'Marbles, Marbles...', introduces several critical vocabulary terms essential for understanding probability and sampling. These include **proportion**, defined as when two ratios or fractions are equal; **percentage**, which refers to parts per 100 or a fraction with a denominator of 100; and **event**, meaning a set of possible outcomes from a particular experiment. The lesson also delves into two crucial sampling methods: **with replacement**, where a population element can be selected multiple times, and **without replacement**, where an element can be selected only once. The essential concepts emphasize that these two sampling methods model real-life situations and highlight that larger samples generally produce results closer to the 'true' probability, thus providing a more accurate estimation of the population."

    "title": "Calculating Initial Probabilities and Conversions in Unit 2 Lesson 10",
    "body": "In Unit 2 Lesson 10, 'Marbles, Marbles...', students begin by considering a fundamental probability scenario: a bag containing 50 marbles, with 20 being blue and 30 being red. The initial question posed to students is to determine the probability of drawing a red marble. The correct answer, 30/50 or 60%, serves as the 'true' probability for this population. Following this, the lesson prompts students to share their methods for converting this **proportion** (30/50) into a **percentage** (60%). This reinforces a key objective of Unit 2 Lesson 10, which is to practice such conversions, ensuring students are comfortable with both representations of probability. Class discussion and journal notes help solidify these foundational mathematical skills."

    "title": "Simulating Random Draws with Replacement in Unit 2 Lesson 10",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 10, 'Marbles, Marbles...', transitions from theoretical probability to practical simulation. After establishing that the probability of drawing a red marble from a bag of 50 (30 red, 20 blue) is 60%, students are asked to consider what happens if they actually draw one marble, record its color, replace it, and repeat this process 10 times. Each individual draw constitutes an 'event'. The students, working in teams, physically engage with the materials: shaking the bag of 50 marbles, drawing one, recording its color in their DS journal, and crucially, replacing the marble back into the bag. This specific action is defined as sampling **with replacement**, a critical concept that ensures the probability of drawing any given color remains constant for each successive draw, modeling real-world scenarios where elements can be re-selected."

    "title": "Variability of Sample Proportions and Defining 'Event' in Unit 2 Lesson 10",
    "body": "A central theme of Unit 2 Lesson 10, 'Marbles, Marbles...', is illustrating that observed outcomes from random events vary. After students conduct 10 draws from their bag of 50 marbles (30 red, 20 blue) **with replacement**, they are asked if the percentage of red marbles in their small sample necessarily matches the 'true' 60% probability. The lesson emphasizes that each marble draw is an **event**, and answers will indeed vary, highlighting the natural variability inherent in random sampling. Teams then calculate their sample proportions based on their 10 draws. This initial small sample size is designed to demonstrate that individual samples often deviate from the expected probability, setting the stage for understanding how larger sample sizes can mitigate this variance and provide a more accurate estimation."

    "title": "Understanding Sampling 'With Replacement' Through Activity in Unit 2 Lesson 10",
    "body": "In Unit 2 Lesson 10, 'Marbles, Marbles...', student teams participate in a hands-on activity to grasp the concept of sampling **with replacement**. Each team is given a bag containing 50 marbles (20 of one color, 30 of another). They are instructed to draw one marble, record its color, and then *replace* it back into the bag before drawing again. This 'with replacement' method means that a marble can be selected multiple times, and the composition of the bag remains constant for every draw, ensuring each individual draw (or 'event') is independent. After 10 such draws, a 'Whip Around' activity allows teams to share their observed counts of red marbles and calculate their corresponding sample proportions. This direct experience helps clarify the definition and implications of sampling **with replacement** as a method of data collection."

    "title": "Analyzing Initial Sample Proportions and the Role of Randomness in Unit 2 Lesson 10",
    "body": "Following their initial 10 draws **with replacement** in Unit 2 Lesson 10, 'Marbles, Marbles...', student teams report their sample proportions, which likely differ from the 'true' probability of 60% for drawing a red marble. A key discussion point in Unit 2 Lesson 10 is to explore *why* these sample proportions might differ from each other and from the expected probability. This leads to the understanding that random events vary, and smaller sample sizes are particularly susceptible to this variation. The activity demonstrates that even with a known population probability, individual samples will show natural fluctuations. This sets the foundation for the next stage of the lesson, where increasing the sample size will reveal a crucial pattern regarding the accuracy of sample proportions."

    "title": "The Impact of Sample Size on Probability Estimation in Unit 2 Lesson 10",
    "body": "A fundamental concept emphasized in Unit 2 Lesson 10, 'Marbles, Marbles...', is the effect of sample size on the accuracy of probability estimations. After conducting 10 draws **with replacement**, students continue the simulation, drawing marbles one at a time, with replacement, until they have recorded 50 **events**. Upon calculating the new sample proportion from these 50 draws, students are prompted to compare it to their earlier 10-draw sample proportion and the 'true' 60% probability. The expected outcome, which students should observe and discuss, is that as the sample size increases (from 10 to 50 draws), the sample proportion tends to get closer to the true population proportion. This illustrates the essential concept that larger samples provide a more reliable and accurate estimate of the underlying probability, a principle often referred to as the law of large numbers in the context of long-run averages."

    "title": "Exploring Sampling 'Without Replacement' in Unit 2 Lesson 10",
    "body": "After thoroughly exploring sampling **with replacement** in Unit 2 Lesson 10, 'Marbles, Marbles...', the lesson introduces the contrasting concept of sampling **without replacement**. Students are asked to consider what this would mean in the context of their marble bag activity. The answer clarifies that 'without replacement' signifies that once a marble is selected, it is *not* returned to the bag. Instead, the next draw occurs from the remaining, smaller set of marbles. This method has significant implications: it changes the probabilities for each subsequent draw, meaning that each **event** is no longer independent. Removing one marble directly impacts the likelihood of drawing specific colors in subsequent draws. This discussion highlights how different sampling methods can alter the underlying probability dynamics of an experiment, modeling various real-world scenarios."

    "title": "Concluding Definitions and Exit Slip from Unit 2 Lesson 10",
    "body": "To consolidate the learning from Unit 2 Lesson 10, 'Marbles, Marbles...', an Exit Slip activity challenges students to define core concepts covered during the lesson. Specifically, students are asked to describe a 'sample,' an 'event,' and 'replacement.' This exercise ensures that students have a clear understanding of the key vocabulary and essential concepts introduced. A 'sample' refers to a subset of data collected from a larger population, such as the 10 or 50 marbles drawn. An 'event' is a single outcome from an experiment, like drawing a red marble. 'Replacement' refers to the act of returning a selected item to the population before the next draw, distinguishing between sampling **with replacement** (where probabilities remain constant) and **without replacement** (where probabilities change with each draw). This reinforces their comprehension of how these elements interact in probability experiments."

    "title": "Transition to Unit 2 Lab 2C and Unit 2 Lesson 11",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 10, 'Marbles, Marbles...', concludes by setting the stage for future learning, specifically Unit 2 Lab 2C, titled 'Which Song Plays Next?'. Students are reminded that while Unit 2 Lesson 8 and Unit 2 Lesson 9 utilized pre-built functions for simulations, Unit 2 Lesson 10 introduced the fundamental principles that will enable them to create their own simulations from scratch. The upcoming Unit 2 Lab 2C will provide the practical application for this skill. Additionally, a 'Class Scribes' activity is planned, where one student team will summarize the three most important topics from Unit 2 Lesson 10, fostering metacognition and peer learning. It is explicitly stated that students must complete Unit 2 Lab 2C prior to moving on to Unit 2 Lesson 11, ensuring a logical progression of their understanding of probability and simulation techniques."
