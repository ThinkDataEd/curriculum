    "title": "Abstract: Exploring Chance and Real Differences in Unit 2 Lesson 14, 'The Titanic Shuffle'",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 14, titled 'The Titanic Shuffle,' is designed to deepen students' understanding that differences observed between two groups can arise purely by chance, and that these chance-driven differences are typically small. The lesson builds upon prior knowledge of shuffling categorical variables, introducing students to the method of shuffling numerical variables, where the difference in medians serves as the primary statistic for analysis. The central activity involves students assuming the roles of Titanic passengers to investigate whether the fare price paid for a cabin influenced a passenger's chance of survival. Initially, students calculate the actual difference in median fare prices between survivors and victims from a representative subset of real Titanic data. To simulate a scenario where survival is purely a matter of chance, students then repeatedly 'shuffle' the survival outcomes, re-group, and recalculate the difference in median fares. By plotting these simulated differences, they construct a distribution that illustrates what differences might occur if chance were the sole factor. This process enables them to compare the observed actual difference against the distribution of chance differences, helping them discern if the initial finding is 'real' or simply due to random variation. The lesson also introduces a formal method for defining 'large' or 'unusual' differences, suggesting that values exceeding two Mean Absolute Deviations (MAD) from the center of the distribution are noteworthy indicators. The activities prepare students for using RStudio in the subsequent Unit 2 Lab 2F, where they will apply these concepts to the complete dataset of 800 Titanic passengers. Additionally, students are tasked with collecting data for the 'Stress/Chill' campaign and completing Unit 2 Lab 2F before Unit 2 Lesson 15."

    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 14 Objectives: Distinguishing Chance from Real Differences with Numerical Data",
    "body": "The primary objective of Unit 2 Lesson 14, 'The Titanic Shuffle,' is to ensure students continue to grasp that, purely by chance, observable differences will emerge between two distinct groups. A key understanding to cultivate is that these differences, when purely attributable to chance, are usually relatively small. The lesson extends previous learning by applying this principle to numerical variables, building on the foundation established with categorical variables in Unit 2 Lesson 13. Essential concepts introduced or reinforced include the idea that data can be 'shuffled' based on numerical variables, with the difference in medians serving as the critical statistic for comparison. The distribution formed through this shuffling process is crucial because it visually represents the range of outcomes expected if chance were the exclusive factor influencing group differences. Consequently, when observed differences are minor, the suspicion arises that they might be purely random. Conversely, when these differences are substantial – or 'big' – it suggests that they are likely 'real' and not merely a product of chance. Students are reminded of the need to consider units when discussing the magnitude of differences, such as percentage points for previous categorical data, preparing them to apply this rigor to numerical data like fare prices. This foundational understanding is critical for distinguishing statistically significant findings from mere random fluctuations in data."

    "title": "Materials and Advance Preparation for Unit 2 Lesson 14: 'The Titanic Shuffle' Activity",
    "body": "For Unit 2 Lesson 14, 'The Titanic Shuffle,' specific materials and advance preparation are essential to facilitate the hands-on learning experience. The primary material is the LMR_Titanic_Strips, which requires advance preparation: the strips must be carefully cut based on the number of students participating, following instructions detailed in step 8 of the lesson plan. Each strip represents data from one of 40 actual Titanic passengers, showing the fare paid on the left and the survival information (survivor or victim) on the right. The cutting ensures that the fare price remains attached to the survival status for each observation, maintaining the integrity of the individual passenger's data point for initial analysis. In addition to these data strips, students will need poster paper, which may be pre-drawn with an x-axis scale ranging from -£30 to £30 to help in plotting fare differences effectively. Markers are also required for students to create dotplots and highlight key findings. These materials are crucial for students to physically engage with the data, initially comparing actual median fare prices between survivors and victims. The subsequent activity of tearing these strips and shuffling only the outcomes further underscores the lesson's objective of understanding how differences might arise by chance. The proper preparation of these resources is paramount for a smooth and effective lesson delivery, allowing students to directly manipulate data and observe statistical principles firsthand."

    "title": "Contextualizing the Data: The Titanic Disaster and Fare Price as a Numerical Variable in Unit 2 Lesson 14",
    "body": "In Unit 2 Lesson 14, 'The Titanic Shuffle,' students transition from analyzing categorical variables to investigating differences involving a numerical variable, specifically focusing on the historical context of the Titanic disaster. To set the stage, students are invited to assume the roles of passengers on the Titanic. For those unfamiliar, a volunteer can share basic knowledge about the ship. The lesson provides a brief historical overview: the Titanic, once the largest and supposedly unsinkable cruise ship, tragically sank on its maiden voyage, becoming one of history's worst maritime disasters. Approximately 40% of passengers survived, but survival chances were significantly influenced by factors such as age, gender, and wealth. The core research question for the lesson is whether the amount of money a passenger paid for their cabin – the fare price – had any correlation with their survival. This numerical variable (fare price) is central to the activity, allowing students to explore real-world implications of statistical analysis. The data used for the activity, presented on individual strips from the LMR_Titanic_Strips, is derived from 40 actual Titanic passengers. While this is a subset, it is highlighted as being randomly selected and representative of the larger 800-passenger dataset, ensuring the validity of the classroom exercise in reflecting real-world trends. This setup prepares students to analyze observed differences in median fare prices between survivor and victim groups, prompting a discussion on whether wealth played a role in survival."

    "title": "Initial Data Analysis: Grouping, Dotplots, and Calculating the Observed Median Fare Difference in Unit 2 Lesson 14",
    "body": "Following the introduction to the Titanic context in Unit 2 Lesson 14, students proceed to a hands-on data analysis phase. Each student receives a strip from the prepared LMR_Titanic_Strips, which details a passenger's fare price and their survival status. The class is then divided into two groups: 'survivors' and 'victims.' If the class size is less than 40 students, roughly 40% are assigned to the survivor group (e.g., 15 out of 40 students, reflecting the approximate actual survival rate of 38.8%), with the remainder forming the victim group. For very small classes (under 10 students), equal-sized groups are suggested. Students in the survivor group receive strips corresponding to survivors, while those in the victim group receive victim strips. It is noted that £20 in 1912 is equivalent to about £2952 today, providing context for the fare prices. Each of these two groups is then tasked with creating a dotplot of their assigned fare prices on poster paper. A quick visual comparison of these dotplots is encouraged to observe initial trends. Crucially, each group calculates the median fare price for their respective 'survivor' and 'victim' groups. As a class, the pivotal next step is to calculate the observed difference between these medians: `median of “Survivor” fares – median of “Victim” fares`. For example, if the median survivor fare was £26.00 and the median victim fare was £13.00, the observed difference would be £13.00. This calculated difference serves as the baseline 'real' observation that will later be compared against differences arising from chance, laying the groundwork for addressing the controversy surrounding wealth and survival on the Titanic."

    "title": "Interpreting Initial Findings and Initiating the Shuffling Simulation in Unit 2 Lesson 14",
    "body": "After calculating the initial observed difference in median fare prices between survivors and victims (e.g., £13.00, as demonstrated in step 13), Unit 2 Lesson 14, 'The Titanic Shuffle,' moves into critical interpretation and the simulation phase. The class discusses the historical controversy surrounding the Titanic, where it was believed that wealthier passengers had preferential access to lifeboats. Students are reminded that the data they are using, although a subset of 40 passengers, was randomly selected from over 800 actual Titanic passengers and is considered representative. In pairs, students are asked to discuss: 'Based on the data from our dotplots, do you think rich people were more likely to survive? Did passengers who paid more for their tickets have a better chance of survival?' The expected answer, guided by the data, is 'Yes,' citing the observed median difference and the rightward shift or right-skewed distribution of survivor fares indicating higher prices. This discussion reinforces the initial evidence suggesting a link between fare price and survival. The lesson then transitions to simulating a world where survival is purely by chance, independent of fare. Students are instructed to tear their strips, separating the fare information from the survival outcome (survivor/victim). Crucially, only the *outcomes* are collected and randomly shuffled, while students retain their original fare strips. The shuffled outcome strips are then redistributed face down. This setup allows students to re-group based on their newly assigned, chance-determined survival status, preparing them for calculating new median differences under the assumption of no relationship between fare and survival. This shuffling mechanism is key to generating the distribution of differences expected purely by chance, a fundamental concept in distinguishing 'real' effects from random variations."

    "title": "The Rationale Behind Shuffling and Analyzing Chance-Based Median Differences in Unit 2 Lesson 14",
    "body": "In Unit 2 Lesson 14, 'The Titanic Shuffle,' once the survival outcomes have been randomly shuffled and redistributed, students delve into the rationale and analysis of this simulation. A crucial discussion point addresses: 'Why do we shuffle the survivor/victim strips and not the fare strips?' The explanation underscores the core assumption of the shuffling process: we are testing if fare price affects survival. By randomly reassigning survival outcomes to existing fare prices, the simulation operates under the null hypothesis that fare price has *nothing* to do with survival. Therefore, the prices themselves should remain fixed, while the survival status is randomized, effectively breaking any potential link between the two variables if one truly existed in the observed data. Students are then prompted to predict: 'What do you think the median fare difference of our shuffled groups will be?' The expected answer is that the median fare difference of the shuffled groups should be close to 0, signifying that under a chance scenario, there should be no systematic difference in fare price between those randomly assigned to survive and those assigned to be victims. This reflects the idea that everyone would have had the same chance of surviving, regardless of their ticket price. Each newly formed, chance-based group calculates its median fare price, and then the class calculates the difference between these new medians. Students are asked to consider if this new difference, which varies with each shuffle, is 'real' or 'due to chance.' Given the deliberate shuffling, any observed difference is understood to be due to chance. These new differences are recorded in a class table and plotted on a 'Difference in Medians' dotplot, which already contains a vertical line marking the original observed difference (e.g., £13.00). This visual comparison highlights how the simulated chance differences typically cluster around zero, contrasting with the actual observed difference."

    "title": "Interpreting the Distribution of Chance Differences and Establishing 'Large' Difference Criteria in Unit 2 Lesson 14",
    "body": "As Unit 2 Lesson 14, 'The Titanic Shuffle,' progresses, students build a distribution of median fare differences obtained through repeated shuffling. After each shuffle, a new dot representing the calculated difference is added to the class dotplot, allowing students to observe the spread of differences that occur purely by chance. A key question is posed: 'How does this difference compare to the actual difference of £13.00 (from Step 13)?' Students typically find that the differences from shuffled data are much smaller than the actual observed difference and tend to be centered around zero. This reinforces the core concept: small differences might be due to chance, whereas 'big' differences typically signify a 'real' underlying difference between groups. In the context of the Titanic data, a 'big' difference would suggest that wealthier passengers were indeed more likely to survive, whereas a 'small' difference would imply survival was merely a matter of luck. To solidify this understanding, steps 17–23 are repeated multiple times, allowing students to contribute to a robust distribution of chance-based median differences. This iterative process is crucial for students to visually grasp the variability inherent in random processes. Subsequently, pairs discuss whether the original £13.00 median fare difference is 'small' or 'large' in the context of the generated distribution. To guide this, the lesson introduces a formal way to define 'large' differences: using cut-off values. Specifically, any difference in median fare prices that is greater than two Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) values above or below the median of the *chance distribution* is considered unusual. This rule means that values falling in the outer edges of the chance plot suggest that a passenger’s ticket price likely had a genuine impact on their survival, moving beyond simple random variation. This quantitative criterion helps students make more informed decisions about the significance of observed differences."

    "title": "Consolidating Learning and Preparing for Advanced Analysis in Unit 2 Lesson 14: 'The Titanic Shuffle'",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 14, 'The Titanic Shuffle,' culminates in consolidating students' understanding of distinguishing chance from 'real' differences and setting the stage for future, more advanced data analysis. The repeated shuffling process and the visual construction of the 'Difference in Medians' dotplot provide a tangible representation of what happens when chance is the only factor at play. By comparing their observed median fare difference (e.g., £13.00) against this distribution, students can make an informed judgment about whether the survival disparity between rich and poor passengers was a 'real' phenomenon or just a random occurrence. The introduction of the '2 MAD rule' offers a quantitative framework for this decision-making, establishing a threshold for what constitutes an 'unusual' difference that is unlikely to be due to chance alone. This rule states that differences beyond two Mean Absolute Deviations from the center of the chance distribution indicate a significant impact of the ticket price on survival. This lesson serves as a crucial foundation for Unit 2 Lab 2F, where students will utilize RStudio to shuffle the complete dataset of all 800 actual Titanic passengers. This transition to computational tools will allow for a more thorough and precise determination of whether the observed difference in survival rates between rich and poor passengers was truly significant or merely a product of random variation, applying the same principles learned through the hands-on activity. Beyond the Titanic analysis, students are also given homework to collect data for the 'Stress/Chill' campaign, accessible via the IDS Think Data Ed App or web browser, fostering continuous engagement with data collection. Completing Unit 2 Lab 2F is mandated prior to commencing Unit 2 Lesson 15, ensuring a logical progression through the curriculum. Finally, a 'Class Scribes' activity encourages students to reflect and discuss the three most important topics learned during the day, reinforcing key takeaways from this impactful lesson on statistical inference."
