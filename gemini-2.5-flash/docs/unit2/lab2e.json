    "title": "Abstract: Permutation Testing for Gender Survival in Slasher Films (Unit 2 Lab 2E)",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lab 2E, titled 'The Horror Movie Shuffle,' guides users through a statistical investigation to determine if women in slasher films are more likely to survive than men. The lab employs permutation testing, a method that uses repeated random shuffling of data to assess the likelihood of an observed event occurring by chance. Users will load and explore the `slasher` dataset, containing information on 485 characters from 50 horror films, to calculate initial survival percentages. Key steps involve understanding the `tally` function, performing single and multiple data shuffles using the `do()` function with `set.seed()` for reproducibility, calculating differences in survival percentages across simulations, visualizing these differences with histograms, and comparing them to the actual observed difference. This process helps users interpret whether gender plays a significant role in character survival beyond mere chance. The lab concludes by asking users to reflect on the findings and explore an alternative shuffling method."

    "title": "Introduction to Unit 2 Lab 2E: Investigating Gender Survival in Slasher Films",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lab 2E, 'The Horror Movie Shuffle,' focuses on a common belief in *slasher* films: that women are more likely to survive than men. This lab addresses the statistical investigative question: 'Are women in slasher films more likely to survive until the end of the film than men?' To answer this question, participants will learn how to utilize permuted data, which involves randomly rearranging existing data to understand the probability of an event occurring purely by chance. The core methodology of Unit 2 Lab 2E involves comparing observed survival differences to distributions generated through repeated random shuffles, allowing for a statistical conclusion on whether gender truly influences survival outcomes. Directions for the lab instruct users to complete questions in blue on their computer and red in their journal."

    "title": "Data Loading and Initial Exploration in Unit 2 Lab 2E: Slasher Dataset",
    "body": "In Unit 2 Lab 2E, 'The Horror Movie Shuffle,' the first step is to load the `slasher` data file using the `data()` function. This dataset is crucial for the investigation, as it contains information about 485 characters sampled from a random sample of 50 *slasher* horror films. After loading, participants are instructed to familiarize themselves with the data by answering initial questions: identifying the number of variables and observations, determining possible values for each variable, and identifying which gender had more survivors based on both counts and percentages. This initial exploration in Unit 2 Lab 2E helps set the stage for calculating the difference between female and male survival percentages and forming preliminary thoughts on whether this difference is large enough to conclude women survive more often."

    "title": "Understanding `tally` Function and Initial Survival Analysis in Unit 2 Lab 2E",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lab 2E emphasizes the correct use of the `tally` function for data analysis. It highlights the critical difference between `tally(~gender | survival, data = slasher, margin = TRUE)` and `tally(~survival | gender, data = slasher, margin = TRUE)`. The latter, `tally(~survival | gender, format = \"percent\", data = slasher, margin = TRUE)`, is identified as the correct approach to calculate the percentage of survivors within each gender group. This distinction is vital for accurately answering initial investigative questions, such as 'Which gender had more survivors?' and 'Calculate the difference between the percentage of females who survived and the percentage of males who survived,' ensuring the percentages are calculated relative to the total within each gender. This precision is fundamental for the statistical investigation within Unit 2 Lab 2E."

    "title": "The Challenge of Chance and Introduction to Permutation Testing in Unit 2 Lab 2E",
    "body": "In Unit 2 Lab 2E, a central challenge is to determine if an observed difference between two quantities, like survival rates in slasher films, is large enough to conclude it didn't just happen by chance. When comparing the survival rates of males and females, a simple difference might not be enough to declare a significant finding. To address this, Unit 2 Lab 2E introduces the concept of repeated random shuffling (permutation testing). This technique is used to estimate how often the *actual* observed difference in survival rates could occur purely by random assignment. By using repeated random shuffling, the lab helps decide when a difference is statistically meaningful and not merely a random fluctuation, forming the statistical basis of the investigation into gender's role in survival."

    "title": "Step-by-Step Data Shuffling Process in Unit 2 Lab 2E",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lab 2E, 'The Horror Movie Shuffle,' introduces the hands-on process of data shuffling as a key component of permutation testing. The lab instructs users to first run `tally(~survival | gender, data = slasher)` to capture the original survival table. Subsequently, the `shuffle()` function is applied to the `survival` variable using `tally(~shuffle(survival) | gender, data = slasher)`. This action randomly reassigns each character's survival status, simulating a scenario where survival is purely random relative to gender. Participants are then asked to compare this randomly generated table to the original, observing how shuffling changes the distribution of survivors across genders, which is a crucial step towards understanding the role of chance in Unit 2 Lab 2E."

  {
    "title": "Analyzing Single Shuffles and the Need for Multiple Simulations in Unit 2 Lab 2E",
    "body": "After performing a single shuffle in Unit 2 Lab 2E, participants are prompted to analyze its effect: 'How many people, in total, survived the slasher film before shuffling? How many people survived after shuffling?' and 'How has shuffling our data changed the percentage of women who survived compared to men who survived?'. Furthermore, they compare the difference in percentages from their shuffled data to the original data. While a single shuffle demonstrates the randomization process, Unit 2 Lab 2E clearly states that 'shuffling our data one time is not enough to decide if the difference seen in our *actual* data occurs by chance or not.' This leads to the critical understanding that multiple simulations are necessary to build a distribution of chance outcomes, which is central to the permutation testing methodology."

  {
    "title": "Performing Multiple Simulations with `do()` and `set.seed()` in Unit 2 Lab 2E",
    "body": "To overcome the limitations of a single shuffle, Unit 2 Lab 2E introduces the `do()` function for performing repeated simulations. Users are instructed to run code to perform multiple shuffles, for example, `do(10) * tally(~shuffle(survival) | gender, format = \"percent\", data = slasher)`, storing the results in `shuffled_outcomes`. The `set.seed()` function (e.g., `set.seed(7)`) is emphasized to ensure reproducibility of the random shuffling process. The lab then asks participants to analyze these preliminary `shuffled_outcomes`, examining how many simulations resulted in a higher percentage of males surviving or identifying the largest difference in survival percentages. Ultimately, Unit 2 Lab 2E tasks users with performing 500 such shuffles using `set.seed(1)` to generate a robust distribution of chance outcomes."

    "title": "Calculating and Analyzing Differences from Simulated Outcomes in Unit 2 Lab 2E",
    "body": "Following the generation of multiple shuffled outcomes in Unit 2 Lab 2E, the next crucial step is to quantify the differences in survival percentages from each simulation. The `mutate()` function is introduced for this purpose. Participants are guided to add a new column, `diff`, to the `shuffled_outcomes` data frame, representing the difference between `Survives.Female` and `Survives.Male` (e.g., `shuffled_outcomes <- mutate(shuffled_outcomes, diff = ____ - ____)`). This transformation allows for a clear comparison of the distribution of chance differences against the actual observed difference from the original `slasher` data. This step is critical for interpreting the patterns emerging from the simulations and preparing for the final decision-making phase in Unit 2 Lab 2E, which investigates if gender plays a role in survival."

    "title": "Visualizing Simulated Differences and Drawing Conclusions in Unit 2 Lab 2E",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lab 2E progresses to the visualization of the calculated differences from the 500 simulations. Participants are instructed to create a `histogram` of the `difference`s in their `shuffled_outcomes` data. This histogram visually represents the typical range and frequency of survival percentage differences that occur purely by chance, based on the `slasher` dataset. To make a statistical decision, the actual difference in survival percentages from the original data (e.g., `22.52252 - 13.30798`) is then added to the histogram as a vertical line using `add_line()`. By observing where this actual difference falls within the distribution of chance differences, participants in Unit 2 Lab 2E can answer key questions: 'Does the actual difference occur very often by chance alone?' and ultimately, 'Does `gender` play a role in whether or not a character will survive in a slasher film?'"

    "title": "Interpreting Permutation Test Results and Final Conclusions in Unit 2 Lab 2E",
    "body": "The final stage of Unit 2 Lab 2E involves interpreting the results from the histogram of simulated differences. The lab explains that if the `survival` label were shuffled, making proportions appear by chance, most of the time the difference in survival proportions between males and females would be close to zero. The histogram typically shows values clustered around zero, representing these chance outcomes. If the actual observed difference, marked by the vertical line, rarely appears within this distribution of chance outcomes, it suggests that 'perhaps there is something more going on than just chance alone.' This leads to the conclusion regarding whether gender plays a significant role in character survival in slasher films, allowing participants to answer whether they would prefer to play a female or male character to survive based on statistical evidence."

    "title": "Summary of Permutation Testing Logic in Unit 2 Lab 2E",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lab 2E provides a concise summary of the underlying logic of permutation testing. It reiterates that by shuffling the `survival` label, the experiment effectively simulates a scenario where the proportion of males and females surviving the slasher film is entirely random, meaning survival occurs purely by chance. The expectation in such a chance-driven scenario is that most of the time, the difference in survival proportions between genders would be close to zero, as evident in the clustering around zero in the generated histograms. The key takeaway from Unit 2 Lab 2E is that if the *actual* observed difference in survival proportions between genders occurs very infrequently within this distribution of chance outcomes, it provides strong evidence that the observed difference is not merely due to chance, suggesting a true underlying effect."

    "title": "Exploring Alternative Shuffling: Gender Variable in Unit 2 Lab 2E",
    "body": "To further solidify understanding and explore the robustness of the findings, Unit 2 Lab 2E includes an 'On your own' activity. Participants are challenged to carry out another 500 simulations, but this time, instead of shuffling the `survival` variable, they are instructed to shuffle the `gender` variable. The use of `set.seed(1)` is again specified to ensure reproducibility of these new simulations. This exercise prompts participants to critically consider how swapping the shuffled variable affects the outcome and interpretation. Key questions posed are: 'Does shuffling the `gender` variable instead of the `survival` variable change your answer to the question?' and 'Does `survival` play a role in a character's `gender`? Why or why not?' This allows for a deeper understanding of variable relationships and the permutation test's application in Unit 2 Lab 2E."

    "title": "Final Reflection on Gender's Role and Survival Strategy in Slasher Films (Unit 2 Lab 2E)",
    "body": "Building upon the permutation test results in Unit 2 Lab 2E, the lab prompts a final reflection on the statistical findings. Participants are asked to conclude whether `gender` plays a role in a character's survival in a slasher film, based on the comparison of the actual difference to the distribution of chance differences. This conclusion is directly tied to the frequency with which the actual difference occurred in the simulated data. The practical implication of the findings is then explored with the question: 'If you wanted to survive in a slasher film, would you want to play a female character or a male character?' This final set of questions in Unit 2 Lab 2E encourages participants to synthesize their statistical understanding into a real-world, albeit fictional, recommendation, reinforcing the practical application of the permutation testing methodology taught throughout the lab."
