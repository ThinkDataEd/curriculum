    "title": "Abstract: Detecting Unfair Dice Through Simulation in Unit 2 Lesson 9",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 9, titled 'Dice Detective,' focuses on teaching students to utilize simulations for identifying an unfair die. The lesson begins with an introduction to dice, their fundamental properties, and the concept of a fair die having equally likely outcomes. Students engage in a hands-on activity involving manual dice rolls, recording outcomes on a poster, and discussing the variability observed in short-term results versus long-run expectations. This foundational activity highlights that small sample sizes often show deviations from ideal probabilities without necessarily indicating unfairness. The core of the lesson transitions to RStudio, where students learn to simulate dice rolls using the `roll_die()` function. They are introduced to RScripts for managing multiple lines of code and use `tally()` and `histogram()` functions to analyze simulated data for larger sample sizes. A key objective is for students to distinguish between a fair and an unfair die by observing patterns and proportions in large-scale simulations, emphasizing the critical role of sample size in detecting subtle biases. The lesson concludes with a discussion on how sample size influences the clarity of results and a homework assignment applying these concepts to a four-sided die."

    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 9: Objective, Materials, and Essential Probability Concepts",
    "body": "The primary objective of Unit 2 Lesson 9, 'Dice Detective,' is for students to acquire the skill of using simulations to effectively detect if a die is unfair. To facilitate this learning experience, several materials are essential: a large poster paper pre-labeled with six columns (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) for tallying results, two physical dice (number cubes), which can be standard hard dice or softer foam dice, and a projector to display RStudio functions and code to the entire class. The lesson builds upon essential concepts of probability introduced previously. A crucial understanding is that in the short term, the actual outcomes of chance experiments, such as rolling a die, will naturally vary from what is considered 'ideal.' While a truly fair die ensures that all six outcomes are equally likely over an infinite number of rolls, this does not mean that in a limited number of trials, one will observe an exactly equal number of one-dots, two-dots, and so forth. This lesson reinforces the idea that probability fundamentally measures how often something occurs in the 'long run,' and simulations are vital tools for observing these long-run patterns and estimating real-life event probabilities."

    "title": "Understanding Dice and Initial Expectations in Unit 2 Lesson 9",
    "body": "In Unit 2 Lesson 9, 'Dice Detective,' students are reminded of or introduced to the fundamental nature of a die, also known as a number cube. A standard die is a six-sided cube, with each face distinctly labeled with dots representing numbers from 1 to 6. A key characteristic of a fair die is that it is weighted in such a way that there is an equal probability of rolling any of its six numbers. Consequently, students are prompted to consider the expected probability of rolling a specific number, such as a 1, when tossing a fair die. The answer confirms that since there are six equally likely outcomes, the probability of rolling any single number, like a 1, is 1/6. This concept of equal probability for a fair die is crucial for understanding later simulations. The lesson then transitions to a hands-on activity. A piece of poster paper, already prepared with columns labeled 1 through 6, is displayed to serve as a tally chart for recording the actual results of physical dice rolls. This visual aid helps students connect theoretical probabilities to empirical observations as they begin their investigation into what constitutes a 'fair' outcome versus a 'varied' outcome in a small sample."

    "title": "Manual Dice Rolling: Setting Up and Predicting Outcomes in Unit 2 Lesson 9",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 9, 'Dice Detective,' involves a practical, hands-on activity where students manually roll dice to observe short-term outcomes. The setup includes a poster paper acting as a tally chart, with columns clearly labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, each representing a possible outcome of a die roll. Two students are selected to serve as 'dice rollers,' each provided with one die. Each student is instructed to roll their die six times, resulting in a total of 12 rolls for the initial sample. Before the rolls commence, students are encouraged to predict the outcomes. For instance, they are asked how many times Student 1 might roll a 3 out of six rolls, and if Student 2's outcome for a 3 would be similar. The expectation for a fair die is that each number would appear approximately once out of six rolls. The concept of independent events is introduced here; each student's roll is independent of the other, and each individual roll for a student is independent, meaning previous outcomes do not influence future ones. For the combined 12 rolls, the class predicts that approximately two tally marks should appear in each column on the chart, reflecting the 1/6 probability across 12 trials for a fair die. This initial prediction sets the stage for comparing expected theoretical outcomes with actual empirical results from a small sample size."

    "title": "Analyzing Manual Dice Roll Results and Introducing Unfairness in Unit 2 Lesson 9",
    "body": "Following the manual dice rolling activity in Unit 2 Lesson 9, 'Dice Detective,' the class observes and discusses the aggregated results on the poster tally chart. With a total of 12 rolls, the discussion focuses on comparing these empirical outcomes against the initial expectations, which were approximately two tally marks per column. It's common for the actual data from such a small sample of 12 rolls to deviate from the expected equal distribution; for example, one number might appear more frequently while another might not appear at all. Students learn that such variability in a small sample is not surprising and does not automatically imply that the dice are unfair. To definitively assess fairness, a larger volume of data is required. The conversation then shifts to hypothetical scenarios: if one *wanted* to create an unfair die, what methods could be employed? Student suggestions might include adding weight to one face (e.g., with tape), which would increase the likelihood of the opposite face appearing, or chipping an edge to alter the die's balance. This segment serves to bridge the understanding from practical observations of variability to the theoretical concept of intentional bias, preparing students for the RStudio simulations where they will actively detect such unfairness using larger datasets."

    "title": "Simulating Dice Rolls with RStudio: Introducing `roll_die()` in Unit 2 Lesson 9",
    "body": "In Unit 2 Lesson 9, 'Dice Detective,' the lesson transitions from manual dice rolls to computational simulations using RStudio, drawing a parallel to previous coin-flipping simulations. The key function introduced for this purpose is `roll_die()`. Unlike the `rflip()` function, `roll_die()` requires specifying which of two pre-built dice, 'A' or 'B,' to roll, in addition to the number of `times` to roll. Students are informed that one of these dice is fair, while the other is unfairâ€”meaning it favors certain outcomes. Their task is to use simulations to identify the unfair die. To manage multiple commands and make the simulation process more efficient, RScripts are introduced as a valuable tool for writing, testing, and executing code. The instructor demonstrates opening an RScript and executing `roll_die(\"A\", times = 1)` to show a single roll. Subsequently, the function is modified to `roll_die(\"A\", times = 12)` to simulate 12 rolls. This simulated outcome is then compared to the results from the earlier 12 manual rolls, providing a direct link between the physical experiment and its digital counterpart. This comparison helps students visualize that even with simulations, small sample sizes can exhibit variability, necessitating more robust analytical tools for detecting true unfairness."

    "title": "Analyzing RStudio Simulations with `tally()` and `histogram()` in Unit 2 Lesson 9",
    "body": "Continuing with RStudio simulations in Unit 2 Lesson 9, 'Dice Detective,' students explore more advanced methods for analyzing larger datasets. The challenge of manually counting outcomes from hundreds of simulated rolls prompts the introduction of the `tally()` function. This function efficiently counts the occurrences of each die value. To streamline the analysis, students learn to assign the results of a simulation to a variable, for example, `sample1 <- roll_die(\"A\", times = 100)`. Once stored, `tally(sample1)` provides raw counts, and `tally(sample1, format = \"proportion\")` calculates the proportion of times each value appeared. Students are reminded that for a fair die, these proportions should be roughly similar to each other and approximate the theoretical probability of 1/6 for each face. The lesson also introduces the `histogram()` function to visually represent the distribution of outcomes. Students predict that for a fair die, a histogram (with `nint = 6` to ensure six bars) would show bars of roughly equal height. The instructor then demonstrates `histogram(sample1, nint = 6)`. Additionally, the utility of RScripts for taking notes, or 'code comments' (using the hashtag `#`), and saving their work is highlighted, emphasizing best practices in data science. This segment equips students with the tools to effectively process and visualize larger simulation data, moving beyond simple counts to proportional and graphical analysis."

    "title": "Detecting Unfairness: Large Sample Sizes and Conclusion in Unit 2 Lesson 9",
    "body": "In Unit 2 Lesson 9, 'Dice Detective,' students apply their RStudio knowledge to identify which of two dice, 'A' or 'B,' is unfair. After analyzing die A, they independently or in pairs begin simulating rolls for die B, starting with 100 rolls, and using `tally()` and `histogram()` functions to observe the outcomes. Initially, with relatively small sample sizes like 100, the results for die B may appear similar to die A, making it difficult to definitively determine unfairness. This reinforces a critical concept: detecting subtle differences in probabilities, such as those caused by an unfair weighting, requires a significantly larger sample size. Students are encouraged to experiment by increasing the `times` argument in the `roll_die()` function. They discover that clear patterns, particularly in the histogram's bar heights, become evident only with very large samples, such as `times = 2000` (the maximum for `roll_die()`). The lesson also introduces how to combine multiple simulation samples using the `c()` function, like `more_rolls <- c(s1, s2)`, to further increase the effective sample size for analysis. Ultimately, through these extensive simulations, students conclude that Die B is unfair, specifically favoring the number 3, while Die A is fair. The concluding discussion emphasizes that larger sample sizes are indispensable for accurately detecting small differences between probabilities, as the 'long run' patterns become distinct only when a substantial amount of data is collected. This segment ties together the objective of the lesson, the practical application of RStudio, and the fundamental statistical principle of sample size importance."

    "title": "Summary of Findings, Reflection, and Homework in Unit 2 Lesson 9",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 9, 'Dice Detective,' culminates in a comprehensive discussion verifying the class's findings regarding the fairness of dice A and B. The consensus confirms that Die A is fair, exhibiting roughly equal probabilities for all outcomes in large simulations, while Die B is unfair, showing a clear favoritism towards the number 3. This discovery directly illustrates the lesson's objective of using simulations to detect an unfair die. A critical part of the wrap-up discussion revolves around the impact of sample size on these findings. Students reflect on why it was necessary to conduct a very large number of simulated rolls (e.g., 2000 or more) to discern the difference between the fair and unfair die. The answer highlights that when the inherent difference in probabilities is small, as it is with a slightly unfair die, a large sample size is essential to allow the underlying pattern to emerge clearly from random short-term fluctuations. Without sufficient data, true biases remain obscured. To foster peer learning and consolidate understanding, the lesson includes 'Class Scribes,' where a team of students summarizes what they consider the three most important topics of the day. For homework, students are challenged to apply their knowledge to a four-sided die, sketching histograms for (a) the ideal expected outcome over 20 rolls, (b) a 'realistic' outcome for 20 rolls (acknowledging short-term variation), and (c) an outcome showing unfairness if the die produced more 4s, reinforcing the visual representation of probability distributions learned in the lesson."
