    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 18, titled \"What's Your Z-Score?\", introduces students to the concept of a z-score as a standardized measure indicating how many standard deviations an observation is from the mean. The lesson emphasizes that typical z-scores range between -3 and +3, and extreme values (outside this range) suggest an outcome is unlikely due to chance. Key concepts include the Empirical Rule, which describes the percentage of data within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean in a normal distribution (68-95-99.7%). Students use RStudio to analyze the `Gestation` dataset, focusing on baby birth weights (`wt`) to calculate means, standard deviations, and visualize normal distributions. The lesson covers the calculation and interpretation of z-scores and percentiles, demonstrating their practical application in understanding data variability. It also prepares students for subsequent hands-on RStudio practice in Unit 2 Labs 2H and 2I, reinforcing the use of normal models."

    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 18 Objective: Z-Scores for Measuring Extremeness and Chance",
    "body": "The primary objective of Unit 2 Lesson 18, \"What's Your Z-Score?\", is for students to comprehend that a z-score serves as a quantitative measure of distance from the mean, expressed in terms of standard deviations. This standardized score allows for comparison of values across different datasets. Students learn that z-scores typically fall within the range of -3 to +3. A crucial application of z-scores in simulations, particularly those involving shuffling, is to assess the likelihood of an outcome occurring by chance. If a computed z-score deviates significantly from the mean (i.e., it's far from zero, like beyond +/-2 or +/-3), it suggests the outcome was not due to random chance. Conversely, a z-score close to the mean (near zero) implies the outcome is likely attributed to chance. This lesson also introduces the foundational idea that z-scores quantify how extreme a value is, independent of its original units of measurement, making them essential for statistical inference and data comparison."

    "title": "Key Materials and Vocabulary for Unit 2 Lesson 18 on Z-Scores",
    "body": "To facilitate Unit 2 Lesson 18, \"What's Your Z-Score?\", essential materials include a projector for displaying RStudio functions, an RScript pre-loaded with lesson functions, and a ruler with centimeter marks for drawing normal curves. The lesson introduces crucial vocabulary. A **z-score**, also known as a **standardized score**, indicates precisely how many standard deviations an observation is away from the mean. It allows for the comparison of data points from different normal distributions. Another fundamental concept is the **Empirical Rule**, which provides a guideline for normal data sets: approximately 68% of observations fall within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% within two standard deviations, and virtually 99.7% within three standard deviations. These terms are integral to understanding the properties of normal distributions and interpreting the significance of a z-score."

    "title": "The Empirical Rule and Normal Distributions in Unit 2 Lesson 18",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 18, \"What's Your Z-Score?\", extensively covers the **Empirical Rule** as an **Essential Concept** for understanding normal distributions. This rule is critical because it states that in a normally distributed data set: approximately 68% of all observations will fall within one standard deviation of the mean; approximately 95% of observations will fall within two standard deviations of the mean; and approximately 99.7% of observations will fall within three standard deviations of the mean. These percentages provide a quick way to gauge the spread of data around the mean. The lesson begins by asking students to recall properties of normal distributions, describing them as unimodal, symmetric, and bell-shaped, with real-life examples like heights or test scores. It distinguishes that while all normal distributions are bell-shaped, not all bell-shaped distributions are normal, highlighting the special properties of true normal distributions, which are quantifiable by the Empirical Rule and later, z-scores."

    "title": "Analyzing the Gestation Dataset with RStudio in Unit 2 Lesson 18",
    "body": "In Unit 2 Lesson 18, \"What's Your Z-Score?\", students engage with RStudio to apply statistical concepts. The lesson guides them through loading the `Gestation` dataset by entering `data(Gestation)` and viewing it with `View(Gestation)`. Students are then prompted to predict which numerical variables within this dataset might exhibit a normal distribution, with variables including birth weight (`wt`), pregnancy length (`gestation`), mother's age (`age`), and others. The focus then narrows to baby birth weights (`wt`), for which a histogram is created using `histogram(~wt, data = Gestation)`. This visual analysis helps students determine if the distribution of birth weights is approximately normal—characterized by being unimodal, roughly symmetric, and somewhat bell-shaped. This hands-on RStudio experience is crucial for understanding how to identify and work with normally distributed data, setting the stage for calculating z-scores and applying the Empirical Rule."

    "title": "Calculating Mean and Standard Deviation for Birth Weights in Unit 2 Lesson 18",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 18, \"What's Your Z-Score?\", guides students to deepen their understanding of normal distributions by calculating key statistical measures for the `Gestation` dataset's `wt` (baby birth weight) variable. After visually assessing the histogram of birth weights to approximate its normality, students are asked to estimate the mean and standard deviation. Subsequently, RStudio is used to compute these actual values precisely: `mean_wt <- mean(~wt, data = Gestation)` yields approximately 119.6 ounces, and `sd_wt <- sd(~wt, data = Gestation)` results in approximately 18.2 ounces. Students then apply these values to construct a number line, marking the mean and points one, two, and three standard deviations above and below it. For example, one standard deviation above the mean is 137.8 ounces (119.6 + 18.2), and one below is 101.4 ounces (119.6 - 18.2). This exercise concretely illustrates the spread of data in a normal distribution, preparing them to apply the Empirical Rule and understand z-scores."

    "title": "Verifying the Empirical Rule and Drawing Normal Curves in Unit 2 Lesson 18",
    "body": "In Unit 2 Lesson 18, \"What's Your Z-Score?\", students verify the applicability of the Empirical Rule to the baby birth weights (`wt`) from the `Gestation` dataset. Using RStudio, they filter the data to find the percentage of babies whose weights fall within one standard deviation of the mean. For instance, `one_sd_wt <- filter(Gestation, wt > 101.4, wt < 137.8)` reveals that approximately 69.7% of babies (861 out of 1236) are within this range, closely matching the Empirical Rule's 68%. Further checks show 94.7% within two standard deviations and 99.4% within three, confirming that the `wt` distribution is approximately normal. With this verification, students then graphically represent this by drawing a normal curve above their labeled number line. This involves plotting dots at specific heights above the mean and standard deviation marks, then connecting them with a smooth curve, effectively modeling the distribution of all baby weights and setting the stage for making predictions."

    "title": "Making Predictions with the Normal Curve Model in Unit 2 Lesson 18",
    "body": "Following the verification of the `Gestation` dataset's `wt` variable as approximately normally distributed, Unit 2 Lesson 18, \"What's Your Z-Score?\", moves into using the constructed normal curve as a predictive model. Students are asked to determine percentages of babies falling within various weight ranges based on the curve and the Empirical Rule. For example, due to the symmetry of a normal distribution, about 50% of babies weigh less than the mean (119.6 ounces). Utilizing the Empirical Rule, students deduce that about 34% of babies weigh between the mean (119.6 ounces) and one standard deviation above it (137.8 ounces), as 68% fall within one standard deviation of the mean, and the curve is symmetric. Consequently, about 16% of babies weigh more than 137.8 ounces (100% - 50% - 34%). This section reinforces how understanding normal distribution properties, especially its symmetry and the Empirical Rule, allows statisticians to make powerful comparisons, draw conclusions, and generate predictions about a population from sample data."

    "title": "Introducing the Z-Score Formula and Interpretation in Unit 2 Lesson 18",
    "body": "A core concept introduced in Unit 2 Lesson 18, \"What's Your Z-Score?\", is the **z-score** itself, also referred to as a **standardized score**. Statisticians use z-scores to compare values by standardizing them, indicating precisely how many standard deviations an observation is from the mean. The lesson formally presents the z-score formula: `z = (x - mean) / s`, where `x` is the observation, `mean` is the population or sample mean, and `s` is the population or sample standard deviation. This formula answers the question: \"How typical is x?\". If an observation `x` is exactly the mean, its z-score is 0. If `x` is one standard deviation above the mean, `z = +1`, and if it's one standard deviation below, `z = -1`. The lesson emphasizes that as one moves farther from the mean on a normal curve, observations become rarer, meaning a large absolute z-score (e.g., greater than 2 or 3) signifies an unusual or extreme value, helping to determine if an outcome is due to chance or a significant deviation."

    "title": "Calculating and Interpreting Z-Scores and Percentiles in Unit 2 Lesson 18",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 18, \"What's Your Z-Score?\", provides practical application of z-scores and introduces percentiles. Students calculate a z-score for a baby weighing 100 ounces using the formula `z = (100 - 119.6) / 18.2`, resulting in -1.08. This negative z-score indicates the baby's weight is below the average. Students learn that typical z-scores in a normal distribution rarely fall outside of -3 to +3. The lesson then explains **percentiles**, which represent the proportion of observations lying below a specific value in a distribution. Using RStudio, `pnorm(100, mean = 119.6, sd = 18.2)` calculates the percentile for the 100-ounce baby as 0.140 or the 14th percentile. This means the baby weighs more than 14% of all babies, which, with a z-score of -1.08 (between -1 and -2 standard deviations), is usually not a cause for concern. Notably, a z-score can also be used to calculate a percentile in a standard normal distribution (mean=0, sd=1) via `pnorm(-1.08, mean = 0, sd = 1) = 0.140`, further highlighting the versatility and standardized nature of z-scores."

    "title": "Continuing Practice with Normal Models: Unit 2 Labs 2H and 2I",
    "body": "To solidify the understanding gained in Unit 2 Lesson 18, \"What's Your Z-Score?\", students are informed that they will continue practicing with normal models in subsequent activities. This involves dedicated RStudio practice over the next few days. Specifically, students will complete **Unit 2 Lab 2H: Eyeballing Normal** and **Unit 2 Lab 2I: R’s Normal Distribution Alphabet**. These labs are designed to reinforce the concepts of normal distributions, z-scores, and percentiles through hands-on application and data analysis within the RStudio environment. The lesson concludes by emphasizing the importance of completing these labs prior to the End of Unit Project, ensuring students have a robust grasp of statistical modeling using normal distributions. The \"Class Scribes\" activity, where students discuss the three most important topics, also serves to summarize and reflect on the key takeaways from Unit 2 Lesson 18, including the role of z-scores in measuring extremeness and determining outcomes not due to chance."
