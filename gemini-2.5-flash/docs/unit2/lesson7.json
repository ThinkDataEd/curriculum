    "title": "Abstract: Unit 2 Lesson 7 - Plot Match and Data Representation",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 7, titled \"Plot Match,\" guides students through understanding and creating boxplots from dotplots. The primary objective is for students to learn how to transform dotplot data into a boxplot representation. Key activities include recalling the components of a five-number summary, sketching boxplots from given dotplots using the \"From Dotplots to Boxplots\" handout (LMR_U2_L7_A), and a matching activity where students identify equivalent data representations across dotplots, histograms, and boxplots using the \"Plot Match\" file (LMR_U2_L7_B). The lesson also delves into discussing the advantages and disadvantages of different graphical representations for various data types, specifically highlighting what features are preserved or hidden when using a boxplot versus a dotplot or histogram. Students reflect on these concepts, record their findings in DS journals, and prepare for Unit 2 Lab 2B."

    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 7: Plot Match - Objectives and Core Skills in Data Visualization",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 7, \"Plot Match,\" focuses on developing students' skills in data visualization, specifically the creation of boxplots from existing dotplots. The core objective is for students to learn the methodical process of constructing a boxplot by first identifying the key components of the five-number summary from a given dotplot. This lesson builds upon prior knowledge, recalling work from Unit 2 Lesson 5 where students constructed boxplots using height data. Through a series of activities, students explore how boxplots serve as an alternative \"representation\" of data distributions, comparing them to other visual forms like dotplots, histograms, bar charts, scatterplots, and tables. Understanding the strengths and limitations of each representation is a critical outcome, particularly what information boxplots may obscure compared to more detailed plots like dotplots or histograms. The lesson emphasizes making informed choices about which graphical representation is most suitable for different types of data and analytical goals."

    "title": "Essential Materials and Advance Preparation for Unit 2 Lesson 7: Plot Match",
    "body": "To effectively deliver Unit 2 Lesson 7, \"Plot Match,\" specific materials and advance preparation are crucial. Students will primarily work with two handouts: the \"From Dotplots to Boxplots\" handout (LMR_U2_L7_A) and sets of plots from the \"Plot Match\" file (LMR_U2_L7_B). The LMR_U2_L7_A handout is used for an activity where student teams sketch boxplots from given dotplots, requiring them to determine and label the five-number summaries. For this handout, page 3 contains an answer key intended solely for teacher reference. The LMR_U2_L7_B file, however, demands significant advance preparation: copies of this file need to be cut out prior to class. Each student team will require a set containing all 15 plots from the \"Plot Match\" file, comprising 5 dotplots, 5 histograms, and 5 boxplots. These cut plots should be organized, for example, by paper clip or zippered bags, to ensure easy distribution and management during the lesson. It is explicitly noted that students should not be asked to cut out these plots during class time, underscoring the importance of this preparatory step."

    "title": "Boxplots and the Five-Number Summary in Data Visualization for Unit 2 Lesson 7",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 7, \"Plot Match,\" delves into the foundational concepts of boxplots and the five-number summary. Boxplots are introduced as a vital \"representation\" for visualizing data distributions, offering an alternative to histograms or dotplots. They are adept at capturing many, though not all, features visible in these other plot types. A core component of this lesson involves students recalling and discussing the elements of the five-number summary: the minimum value, the 1st quartile (Q1), the median, the 3rd quartile (Q3), and the maximum value. This recall begins with an \"Entrance Slip\" activity, ensuring students have a solid grasp of these components which are essential for constructing and interpreting boxplots. The lesson explicitly connects to prior learning, reminding students of their experience creating boxplots from student height data in Unit 2 Lesson 5. This reinforces the practical application of the five-number summary in summarizing data distribution, especially useful for datasets that are heavily skewed or contain outliers."

    "title": "Hands-On Activity: Sketching Boxplots from Dotplots in Unit 2 Lesson 7",
    "body": "A key activity in Unit 2 Lesson 7, \"Plot Match,\" involves students directly constructing boxplots from given dotplots. This hands-on task utilizes the \"From Dotplots to Boxplots\" handout (LMR_U2_L7_A). Working in teams, students are challenged to analyze various dotplots and, for each, accurately determine the five-number summary. This includes identifying the minimum, 1st quartile (Q1), median, 3rd quartile (Q3), and maximum values. Once these values are identified, students sketch the corresponding boxplots, meticulously labeling each component of the five-number summary on their plots. Following this construction phase, teams discuss and answer three questions included in the handout. A class share-out then consolidates understanding, allowing students to compare their sketches and reasoning. The lesson highlights that a boxplot is one form of \"representation\" of a variable's distribution, prompting students to consider how different visual forms convey information. For teacher convenience, page 3 of LMR_U2_L7_A provides an answer key for reference."

    "title": "Comparing Data Representations and Their Utility in Unit 2 Lesson 7",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 7, \"Plot Match,\" extends beyond boxplot creation to a broader discussion of data \"representation.\" Students are prompted to recall various representations of distributions they have encountered, such as dotplots, bar charts, scatterplots, histograms, and tables. The lesson culminates in a critical discussion and journaling activity about the appropriate use cases for different plot types. Students record insights into their DS journals, addressing questions like: Which data types are best suited for histograms (e.g., almost any data, larger datasets, showing shape and skewness)? Which are best for dotplots (e.g., showing shape, preferred for smaller amounts of data)? And when are boxplots most effective (e.g., for distributions with one mode, heavily skewed data, or data with outliers)? A crucial aspect of this discussion involves identifying the characteristics of data that become hidden when a boxplot is used instead of a dotplot or histogram. For instance, boxplots generally obscure the number of modes in a distribution and the overall shape, making it difficult to detect bimodality. This critical analysis helps students understand the trade-offs in choosing a data visualization."

    "title": "Activity 2: Matching Different Data Representations in Unit 2 Lesson 7",
    "body": "A significant and interactive component of Unit 2 Lesson 7, \"Plot Match,\" is the \"Plot Match\" file activity (LMR_U2_L7_B). This activity challenges student teams to identify different graphical \"representations\" that depict the same underlying data. Each team receives a pre-cut set of 15 plots, specifically 5 dotplots, 5 histograms, and 5 boxplots. It is imperative that these plots are cut and sorted prior to class time, as detailed in the advance preparation notes, to ensure smooth execution of the activity. The students' task is to work collaboratively to match these 15 individual plots into 5 distinct groupings, where each grouping consists of a dotplot, a histogram, and a boxplot that all represent the identical dataset. This exercise fosters a deeper understanding of how data can be visually presented in multiple ways while retaining the same underlying statistical properties. Following the team activity, a class share-out is conducted until all students reach a consensus on the correct groupings, reinforcing the learning objective of recognizing equivalent data representations."

    "title": "Journaling and Discussion: Optimal Use Cases for Histograms, Dotplots, and Boxplots in Unit 2 Lesson 7",
    "body": "Following the \"Plot Match\" activity in Unit 2 Lesson 7, students engage in a crucial reflective process, recording their insights into their DS journals. This journaling session addresses specific questions designed to solidify their understanding of data visualization choices. Key questions include: What types of data are best suited for a histogram? The answer emphasizes histograms' versatility for almost any data type, especially larger datasets, and their ability to clearly show distribution shape, skewness, and multiple peaks. What types of data are best for a dotplot? Dotplots are highlighted for their effectiveness in showing distribution shape, particularly preferred over histograms when dealing with relatively smaller amounts of data. And what types of data are best for a boxplot? Boxplots are deemed useful for distributions with a single mode, heavily skewed data, or data containing outliers. This guided reflection helps students articulate the practical considerations for selecting an appropriate graphical \"representation\" based on the characteristics of the data and the insights desired."

    "title": "Features Hidden by Boxplots and Reinforcing the Five-Number Summary in Unit 2 Lesson 7",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 7, \"Plot Match,\" includes a critical discussion point: identifying what characteristics of data become obscured when a boxplot is used instead of a dotplot or histogram. Students record in their DS journals that boxplots, while excellent for summarizing the five-number summary (minimum, Q1, median, Q3, maximum) and identifying outliers, often fail to reveal the number of modes (peaks) in a distribution. For instance, a bimodal distribution would not be apparent in a boxplot, thus hiding the overall shape. This highlights a limitation of boxplots as a \"representation\" of data. The lesson initiates with an \"Entrance Slip\" and discussion to recall these five-number summary components, building on their experience in Unit 2 Lesson 5 where they created boxplots from height data. By the end of Unit 2 Lesson 7, students are expected to not only construct boxplots but also critically assess their utility and understand the information they prioritize versus what they may unintentionally conceal, especially in the context of comparing distributions."

    "title": "Detailed Materials and Critical Pre-Class Preparation for Unit 2 Lesson 7 Activities",
    "body": "The successful execution of Unit 2 Lesson 7, \"Plot Match,\" heavily relies on precise material management and essential advance preparation. The lesson requires two main learning resources: the \"From Dotplots to Boxplots\" handout (LMR_U2_L7_A) and sets of plots derived from the \"Plot Match\" file (LMR_U2_L7_B). LMR_U2_L7_A facilitates a sketching activity where students convert dotplots to boxplots, determining the five-number summary; a teacher-only answer key is on page 3. The most critical preparatory step involves LMR_U2_L7_B. This file contains 15 plots—5 dotplots, 5 histograms, and 5 boxplots—which must be meticulously cut out before class begins. Each student team needs a complete set of these 15 plots for the \"Plot Match\" activity. To maintain organization and ease of distribution, it's recommended to paper clip or place each team's set into zippered bags. Underscoring its importance, the instructions explicitly state: \"Do not distribute the handout for students to cut out the plots!\" This ensures valuable class time is spent on learning objectives rather than manual preparation, allowing students to focus on matching different \"representations\" of the same data."
