    "title": "Abstract: Unit 2 Lesson 1 - What is Your True Color?",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 1, titled \"What is Your True Color?\", aims to engage students in collecting personal data and understanding how to subset this data. The lesson utilizes the *True Colors Personality Test* to categorize students into personality types: Blue, Gold, Green, and Orange. Students begin by taking a personality test and identifying their predominant color. They then physically group themselves by their predominant color, recording group statistics and discussing common characteristics to grasp the concept of a 'typical' value within a group. A core activity involves introducing data subsetting by dividing the color groups into \"introvert\" and \"extrovert\" categories, recording this information in a two-way frequency table. Following this, students create visualizations comparing these subsets, with specific instructions for different color groups on how to structure their visual representations (e.g., Orange and Gold groups subsetting color by introverts/extroverts, while Blue and Green groups subset introverts/extroverts by color). This activity reinforces concepts from Unit 1 Lessons 16 and 17 on two-way tables and relative frequencies. The lesson concludes with students comparing their group's perceived characteristics to official personality descriptions, summarizing their findings, and recording their data in the \"Personality Color\" campaign via the IDS ThinkData Ed App. Homework involves completing this survey if not finished in class. This lesson provides practical experience in data collection, organization, visualization, and basic statistical interpretation."

    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 1: What is Your True Color? - Objectives and Core Concepts",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 1, \"What is Your True Color?\", focuses on providing students with hands-on experience in data collection and an introduction to data organization through subsetting. The primary objective for students in this lesson is to collect data related to their personality types using the *True Colors Personality Test* and develop an understanding of how to effectively subset their collected data. The lesson emphasizes an essential statistical concept: recognizing that a 'typical' value can represent an entire group, even though individual members within that group may not perfectly align with that value. This foundational understanding is crucial for later data analysis. Key materials for this lesson include the *True Colors Personality Test* document ([LMR_U2_L1](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_6.0/LMR_U2_L1.pdf)), which guides students through identifying their personality colors (Blue, Gold, Green, and Orange). Other necessary materials are posted signs for each personality color, poster paper and markers for data visualization activities, and data collection devices. Advance preparation is required to label and post these signs within the classroom. The vocabulary word introduced in this lesson is \"subsets,\" defined as \"a set of which all the variables are contained in another set,\" which is fundamental to the data organization activities."

    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 1: Personality Data Collection and Predominant Color Identification",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 1, \"What is Your True Color?\", begins by prompting students to reflect on their self-knowledge and their understanding of classmates before introducing the *True Colors Personality Test*. This test, documented in [LMR_U2_L1](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_6.0/LMR_U2_L1.pdf), is utilized to help students explore fundamental statistical concepts through personal data. Students are provided with the first two pages of the *True Colors Personality Test*, specifically withholding the page that describes each personality color to encourage initial self-reflection and group discussion before official descriptions are revealed. Instructions are given for completing the test, which involves students scoring themselves across four personality colors: Blue, Gold, Green, and Orange. A crucial note in the lesson reminds students to add scores across rows for each color, not straight down columns, to ensure accurate results. After completing the test, students record each color's score and identify their \"predominant color\"—the color with the highest score—in their DS journals. The objective is for students to collect this personal data to later understand how to subset it, linking their individual results to broader group characteristics and the essential concept of a 'typical' value."

    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 1: Grouping by Personality and Identifying Typical Traits",
    "body": "In Unit 2 Lesson 1, \"What is Your True Color?\", after students have completed the *True Colors Personality Test* and identified their predominant personality color (Blue, Gold, Green, or Orange), the lesson moves into a practical demonstration of data organization and analysis. Signs for each personality color are posted around the classroom, requiring advance preparation. Students are then asked to gather physically by the sign corresponding to their predominant personality color. This tangible grouping allows for immediate data collection and observation. Within their DS journals, students record important group statistics, such as the number of students in their own color group, the number of students in each of the other color groups, and what the predominant personality color in the entire class is. This exercise directly supports the lesson's objective of collecting data and understanding group dynamics. Following this, each color group engages in discussions to determine common characteristics among their members. Guided questions, such as \"What are your likes and dislikes?\" and \"What do you have in common?\", help steer these conversations. The goal is for each team to reach a consensus on describing their group, which they then share with the whole class. This activity aims to get students thinking deeply about \"What is typical?\" within their specific groups, reinforcing the essential concept that a 'typical' value can represent a group even with individual variations. Dominant characteristics identified by the groups are recorded on the board, setting up a comparison with official descriptions later in the lesson."

    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 1: Introducing Data Subsetting and Two-Way Frequency Tables",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 1, \"What is Your True Color?\", advances from initial personality grouping to introducing the critical concept of data subsetting. Following the discussion of group characteristics, students are instructed to further organize their collected data by dividing their existing personality color groups (Blue, Gold, Green, Orange) into two **subsets**: introverts and extroverts. The vocabulary term \"subsets\" is defined as a smaller set whose variables are entirely contained within a larger set, which is precisely what this activity demonstrates. To visually represent this new layer of data organization, a two-way frequency table is created on the board. This table serves as a structured method for students to record the distribution of introverts and extroverts within each of the four personality color groups. This practical application of subsetting is a core objective of the lesson, enabling students to see how data can be broken down and analyzed in more detail than just simple counts. The materials used, such as poster paper and markers, will facilitate the subsequent step of visualizing these subsets. This activity reinforces the understanding that data can be categorized in multiple ways, laying the groundwork for more complex data analysis and visualization. The process of physically regrouping and then recording these new subsets on a two-way table helps solidify the understanding of how to organize and represent categorized data, further enhancing their data collection and organization skills introduced earlier in the lesson."

    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 1: Creating and Interpreting Visualizations of Subsets",
    "body": "In Unit 2 Lesson 1, \"What is Your True Color?\", after organizing data into personality color groups and then subsetting these groups by introvert and extrovert categories, students move on to visualizing this multi-dimensional data. Each team is provided with poster paper and markers to create visual representations of their subsets. There are specific instructions for how different groups should approach their visualizations: the Orange and Gold groups are tasked with creating visuals that subset the color variable by introverts and extroverts, while the Blue and Green groups are to create visualizations that subset introverts and extroverts by color. This distinction highlights different ways to view and analyze the same dataset. If students face confusion, they are encouraged to recall their previous learning from Unit 1 Lessons 16 and 17, which covered two-way tables and relative frequencies, providing a direct link to prior knowledge. The Orange and Gold groups will effectively be focusing on comparing introverts and extroverts across the columns of a two-way table, whereas the Blue and Green groups will be comparing colors across the rows. After creating their visuals, each pair of groups (Orange/Gold and Blue/Green) selects one poster to display. The lesson culminates in a class discussion comparing these two distinct visualizations. Students are guided through analyzing and interpreting the plots by answering questions such as the type of plot, the number of variables present, information gathered from the visualization, what they see the most/least of, and the 'typical' personality color or typical group (introverts/extroverts) for the subset. This hands-on visualization and interpretation reinforces the lesson's objective of understanding data subsetting and the essential concept of a 'typical' value within specific data partitions."

    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 1: Validating Perceptions and Recording Data in the Campaign",
    "body": "As Unit 2 Lesson 1, \"What is Your True Color?\", draws to a close, students engage in a crucial validation step and formal data entry. After analyzing their visual representations of subsetted personality data, students are prompted to summarize their impressions of the class's personality color data in their DS journals. The lesson then transitions to revealing the official descriptions of each personality color. Page 3 of the *True Colors Personality Test* ([LMR_U2_L1](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_6.0/LMR_U2_L1.pdf)) is distributed, providing detailed descriptions for Blue, Gold, Green, and Orange personalities. Students are reminded that their highest score indicates their predominant color, and the second highest is their secondary color; in case of a tie, they choose the description that best fits. This allows students to compare the characteristics they perceived within their groups during step 7 of the lesson with the actual descriptions provided. The discussion focuses on how accurate these descriptions are and whether they match student-generated traits. This comparison activity allows students to critically evaluate the initial data and their interpretations. Finally, to formalize their data collection, students record their personal personality data by completing the \"Personality Color\" campaign. This is done either through the IDS ThinkData Ed App or via the web browser at [https://portal.thinkdataed.org](https://portal.thinkdataed.org){:target=\"_blank\"}. This step ensures that the collected data is logged in a structured format for potential future analysis, fulfilling the lesson's objective of collecting and organizing data."

    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 1: Learning Outcomes, Reflection, and Campaign Submission",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 1, \"What is Your True Color?\", provides a comprehensive experience in data collection, organization, and basic statistical interpretation. The lesson effectively achieves its objectives, enabling students to collect data about their personality types using the *True Colors Personality Test* and understand the fundamental process of subsetting that data. The essential concept of a 'typical' value, representing a group despite individual variations, is explored through group discussions and data analysis. Students have hands-on experience in identifying predominant personality colors, grouping themselves accordingly, and then further subsetting their data into introvert and extrovert categories, recording these in two-way frequency tables. The creation and interpretation of diverse data visualizations for these subsets reinforce their understanding of data representation, drawing upon prior knowledge from Unit 1 Lessons 16 and 17. The lesson concludes with students reflecting on the accuracy of their initial perceptions by comparing them to official personality descriptions and summarizing their findings in their DS journals. An important final step is the formal recording of their collected personality data by completing the \"Personality Color\" campaign. This data entry is performed using the IDS ThinkData Ed App or web browser at [https://portal.thinkdataed.org](https://portal.thinkdataed.org){:target=\"_blank\"}. To foster meta-cognition, one team of students acts as \"Class Scribes,\" discussing the three most important topics learned during the day. As homework, any students who did not complete the \"Personality Color\" survey during class are required to do so via the app or web browser, ensuring all data is captured for the campaign."
