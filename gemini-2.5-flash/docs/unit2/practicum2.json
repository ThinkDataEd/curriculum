    "title": "Abstract: Practicum \"Win Win Win\" - Simulating Daily 3 Probabilities",
    "body": "The \"Win Win Win\" Practicum, located at `.\\docs\\unit2\\practicum2.md`, guides students through creating and combining simulations to assess probabilities related to the California *Daily 3* lottery game. This practicum requires students to simulate the *Daily 3* game, which involves drawing 3 numbers between 0-9 with replacement, both individually and within teams. Key tasks include writing simulation code, performing 500 simulations, calculating the estimated probability of matching specific numbers (e.g., the first two), and comparing these probabilities. The practicum culminates in a team-based task to combine simulation estimates for the overall winning probability and submission of a one-page report with the code. This exercise builds upon concepts learned in Unit 2 Lab 2C and Unit 2 Lab 2D, ensuring each piece of information is self-contained and understandable."

    "title": "Practicum \"Win Win Win\": Objective, Context, and Resources",
    "body": "The primary objective of the \"Win Win Win\" Practicum, detailed in `.\\docs\\unit2\\practicum2.md`, is for students to develop proficiency in creating and combining simulations to effectively assess probabilities. This hands-on exercise is designed to deepen understanding of probabilistic concepts through practical application. Students will utilize the specific \"Win Win Win Practicum\" material, referenced by `LMR_U2_Practicum_Win_Win_Win.pdf` (located at `../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_6.0/LMR_U2_Practicum_Win_Win_Win.pdf`). The practicum centers around simulating the California *Daily 3* lottery game to explore various probability scenarios. This foundational work leverages knowledge gained from prior activities such as Unit 2 Lab 2C and Unit 2 Lab 2D, ensuring a self-contained learning experience."

    "title": "Understanding the Daily 3 Lottery Game Mechanics",
    "body": "The \"Win Win Win\" Practicum requires students to simulate the California lottery's *Daily 3* game. This game involves the daily drawing of three numbers, each ranging from 0 to 9. A crucial rule is that the numbers are drawn \"with replacement,\" meaning each number is independent and can be drawn multiple times. While winners typically receive a couple hundred dollars, the maximum prize is awarded only when players correctly choose all three numbers in the exact order they are drawn. Understanding these specific rules, including the \"with replacement\" condition, is fundamental for accurately simulating the game and assessing probabilities, as explored in tasks within the practicum and building on concepts from Unit 2 Lab 2C and Unit 2 Lab 2D. Each piece of information in this description is self-contained."

    "title": "Individual Simulation and Probability Calculation Tasks in Practicum \"Win Win Win\"",
    "body": "Students participating in the \"Win Win Win\" Practicum are tasked with several core activities to develop their simulation and probability assessment skills. Drawing upon principles from Unit 2 Lab 2C (\"Which song plays next?\") and Unit 2 Lab 2D (\"Queue it up!\"), the initial steps involve writing code to simulate a single instance of the *Daily 3* lottery game. This code is then used to perform 500 simulations of the *Daily 3*. A key analytical task is to compute the estimated probability of correctly guessing the first two numbers of the *Daily 3*. Furthermore, students must analyze and explain whether the estimated probability of correctly guessing the last two numbers should be less than, the same as, or more than guessing the first two numbers, demonstrating an understanding of independent events and probability. This chunk is self-contained and provides specific instructions."

    "title": "Team Collaboration and Final Report Requirements for \"Win Win Win\"",
    "body": "The \"Win Win Win\" Practicum includes a significant team-based component to enhance learning about combined simulations and probability. In teams of four, each member is required to independently choose three numbers for the *Daily 3* and then simulate the game 500 times using their chosen numbers. The team's estimates are then combined to arrive at a collective, more robust estimate of the probability of winning the *Daily 3* overall. The practicum concludes with the submission of a comprehensive one-page report. This report must include all the code written for the simulations, documenting the entire process from individual simulations to the combined team analysis. This collaborative effort builds on the individual tasks derived from Unit 2 Lab 2C and Unit 2 Lab 2D, and is understandable without external context."

    "title": "Applying Simulation Concepts: Building on Unit 2 Lab 2C and Unit 2 Lab 2D",
    "body": "The \"Win Win Win\" Practicum's objective to create and combine simulations to assess probabilities is directly linked to prior learning and designed to be a self-contained learning unit. Students are expected to leverage the knowledge and skills acquired in Unit 2 Lab 2C (\"Which song plays next?\") and Unit 2 Lab 2D (\"Queue it up!\"). These labs provided foundational experience in simulating random events and understanding probabilistic outcomes, which are critical for tackling the *Daily 3* lottery simulation. The practicum challenges students to apply these simulation techniques to a real-world scenario, such as writing code to simulate a single draw of the *Daily 3* and then scaling this to 500 simulations, forming the basis for estimating various probabilities in the California lottery game."

    "title": "Detailed Probability Analysis in Daily 3: Order, Independence, and Estimation",
    "body": "A central part of the \"Win Win Win\" Practicum involves a detailed analysis of probabilities within the *Daily 3* lottery game, which is designed to be self-contained. The game's rules, specifically that numbers are drawn \"with replacement,\" are key to understanding the independence of each digit. Students are not only asked to compute the estimated probability of correctly guessing the first two numbers but also to critically compare this to the probability of guessing the last two numbers. The task requires students to explain *why* these probabilities relate as they do (less than, the same as, or more than), reinforcing their understanding of independent events and the consistent probability for each position. This analysis directly applies the simulation techniques practiced, drawing insights from lessons in Unit 2 Lab 2C and Unit 2 Lab 2D."

    "title": "Comprehensive Reporting and Code Submission for the \"Win Win Win\" Practicum",
    "body": "A mandatory final component of the \"Win Win Win\" Practicum is the creation and submission of a one-page report. This report serves as a complete documentation of the student's work and findings, and should be understandable by itself. It must comprehensively include all the code developed to simulate the *Daily 3* lottery game, encompassing both the single-simulation script and the method used for 500 simulations. Beyond the code, the report should detail the computed estimated probabilities, particularly for correctly guessing the first two numbers, and the rationale behind the comparison of probabilities for guessing the first two versus the last two numbers. For teams, the report should also reflect the combined simulation estimates for the overall winning probability, demonstrating a full understanding of the practicum's objectives and the concepts from Unit 2 Lab 2C and Unit 2 Lab 2D."
