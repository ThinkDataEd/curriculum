    "title": "Unit 2, Section 3: Exploring Chance and Stress/Chill with Permutations",
    "body": "Unit 2, Section 3, \"What Are the Chances That You Are Stressing or Chilling?\", is designed for 8 instructional days. This unit introduces the enduring understanding that permutations provide a crucial model for understanding real-world phenomena. By generating permutations of data, students can observe how the world might behave if differences between groups or associations between variables were solely due to chance. This foundational concept allows learners to establish a baseline for randomness, against which actual observations can be compared. The core idea is that if an observed outcome is a common permutation, chance may be a sufficient explanation, whereas a rare permutation suggests that chance is unlikely to be the sole factor, implying a dependent relationship between variables."

    "title": "Permutations and the Rejection of Chance Models in Unit 2, Section 3",
    "body": "A key enduring understanding within Unit 2, Section 3, \"What Are the Chances That You Are Stressing or Chilling?\", revolves around using permuted data to make significant inferences. The unit emphasizes that comparing actual observations with a model generated by permutations allows students to assess the validity of chance as an explanation. Specifically, if an actual observation is a rare occurrence within the distribution of permuted data, it suggests that chance alone is not a good explanation for the observed difference or association. Conversely, if the actual observation aligns with common permutations, chance remains a plausible explanation. This comparison process enables students to reject the chance model when warranted, thereby indicating the presence of a dependent relationship between variables. This understanding is critical for evaluating real-world data and scientific reports."

    "body": "Unit 2, Section 3, \"What Are the Chances That You Are Stressing or Chilling?\", establishes several critical learning objectives. Statistically, students will address S-IC 2, focusing on deciding if a specified model is consistent with results from a given data-generating process, e.g., using simulation. From a Data Science perspective, a key objective is to understand that a chance model serves as an indicator of whether associations in actual data are due to mere chance. This includes grasping why a plot might visually suggest a trend but could in reality be the outcome of randomness. Furthermore, the unit connects these concepts to real-world scenarios, empowering citizens to critically interpret media reports of scientific and medical findings by understanding if observed outcomes happen by chance."
