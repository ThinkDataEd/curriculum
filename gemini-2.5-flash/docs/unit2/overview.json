    "title": "Abstract: Introduction to Data Science Unit 2 Overview",
    "body": "Unit 2 of the Introduction to Data Science curriculum spans 35 days, divided into five core themes, and culminates in an End of Unit Project. The unit provides a comprehensive introduction to foundational data science concepts, beginning with descriptive statistics and progressing through probability, statistical inference, and the normal distribution. The first theme, 'What Is Your True Color?' (10 days), focuses on measures of center (mean, median) and spread (Mean Absolute Deviation - MAD, Interquartile Range - IQR), boxplots, and comparing distributions, primarily using the 'Personality Color' campaign data. The second theme, 'How Likely Is It?' (7 days), delves into probability, simulations, simple and compound events, and utilizing R functions like `do` loops and `set.seed()`. The third theme, 'Are You Stressing or Chilling?' (8 days), introduces inference, chance differences for categorical and numerical variables, the `shuffle()` function, and crucial data manipulation techniques such as merging datasets, often utilizing data from the 'Stress/Chill' and 'Personality Color' campaigns. The fourth theme, 'What’s Normal?' (5 days), explores the normal curve, standard deviation (SD), z-scores, and R functions for normal probability (`rnorm()`, `pnorm()`, `qnorm()`). The final 5 days are dedicated to the 'End of Unit 2 Project: Comparing Groups Using Our Own Data', requiring a synthesis of all learned concepts, often leveraging data from campaigns like 'Stress/Chill', 'Personality Color', 'Food Habits', or 'Time Use'. This unit emphasizes practical application through lessons, labs, and practicums, preparing students to analyze and interpret real-world data."
