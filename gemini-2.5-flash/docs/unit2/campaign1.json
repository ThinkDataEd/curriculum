    "title": "Abstract for Unit 2 Campaign 1: Stress/Chill Guidelines",
    "body": "This document outlines the \"Stress/Chill\" campaign, Unit 2 Campaign 1, designed to help students understand stress levels and variability. The campaign addresses the increasing prevalence of stress in daily life across different age groups. Through a two-week data collection phase, students will use random surveys twice daily to record their environment, company, and perceived stress levels, alongside automatic collection of location, time, and date. The primary objectives are to teach students about group comparisons, variability, informal inference using permutations, and predictive simulations. Students will engage with data from the first day using the Plot App and Campaign Monitoring tool to foster engagement. Technical analysis will be performed using RStudio, guiding students to analyze their individual and class-wide stress patterns, considering factors like weekday/weekend and social settings. The campaign culminates in a \"Stress/Chill Practicum\" report where students apply their analytical skills."

    "title": "Unit 2 Campaign 1: Stress/Chill – Campaign Overview and Learning Objectives",
    "body": "Unit 2 Campaign 1, titled \"Stress/Chill,\" is a comprehensive campaign designed to investigate and understand daily stress levels. The core issue addressed is the widespread increase in reported stress among adults, children, and teenagers, often linked to increasing responsibilities. This campaign aims to provide students with practical experience in data analysis and statistical inference. Upon completion, students are expected to have developed a deep understanding of variability both within and between different groups. Key learning objectives include mastering the conduct and application of permutations for modeling variability, performing informal inference, and utilizing simulations to make informed predictions. The campaign explicitly focuses on allowing students to compare groups and gain insights into factors affecting stress and chill levels in various contexts, preparing them for the final \"Stress/Chill Practicum.\""

    "title": "The Escalating Issue of Stress and Guiding Questions for Unit 2 Campaign 1",
    "body": "Unit 2 Campaign 1, \"Stress/Chill,\" addresses a critical societal issue: the daily increase in reported stress levels, which now affects not only adults but also children and teenagers, often linked to increasing workloads. To explore this phenomenon, the campaign prompts students to consider several fundamental questions that will guide their data collection and analysis. These include identifying factors that influence individual stress or chill levels, examining whether different personality types experience happiness or sadness differently, assessing the impact of being alone versus with people, and determining if one's stress/chill level is a function of the surrounding environment. These initial inquiries form the basis for the campaign's objectives, encouraging students to understand the multifaceted nature of stress and its variations."

    "title": "Data Collection Methodology for Unit 2 Campaign 1: Stress/Chill",
    "body": "For Unit 2 Campaign 1, \"Stress/Chill,\" data collection is meticulously structured to capture daily stress experiences. Students are required to use a random number generator to select two random times per day over a period of 6 days, ensuring that at least one weekend is included within this timeframe. It is recommended that teachers generate 6 unique sets of random numbers so that students are polled at different, unpredictable times each day. Teachers have the discretion to decide if a randomly selected time falling within the school day should be used for the survey. The entire survey period spans approximately two weeks, with the explicit goal of incorporating at least two weekend days for comprehensive data capture, enabling a broader analysis of stress patterns."

    "title": "Detailed Survey Variables and Prompts in Unit 2 Campaign 1 Stress/Chill Survey",
    "body": "The \"Stress/Chill\" campaign in Unit 2 Campaign 1 utilizes a specific set of survey questions and variables to gather comprehensive data on students' stress levels and contextual factors. The prompts include: \"Where are you?\" with categorical options like school, work, home, public place, others’ house, or commuting (variable: `where`, data type: categorical). Students also answer \"Why are you here (in one word)?\" (variable: `why`, data type: text). Quantitative data includes \"How many people are you with (not counting yourself)?\" (variable: `howmanypeople`, data type: integer), and \"Who are you with?\" (variable: `who`, data type: categorical, with options like alone, friends and/or family, teachers and classmates, strangers, or coworkers). The core stress measurement is \"How stressed are you feeling right now (3 is very stressed, 0 is not stressed at all)?\" (variable: `stress`, data type: integer). Additionally, `location` (latitude, longitude), `time`, and `date` are automatically recorded, providing crucial contextual metadata for each survey response, supporting the campaign's objectives of understanding variability."

    "title": "Engaging Students and Motivating Data Collection in Unit 2 Campaign 1",
    "body": "A key aspect of Unit 2 Campaign 1, \"Stress/Chill,\" is ensuring consistent student engagement and diligent data collection throughout the approximately two-week campaign. To motivate students, teachers should emphasize the necessity of continuous data collection. After the first day of data gathering, the Plot App is to be utilized to visualize the preliminary data. This initial data review should spark a discussion, prompting students to consider questions such as \"Why were most people stressed?\" Teachers are encouraged to guide students through this initial analytical process, which helps achieve the campaign's objectives of understanding variability. Furthermore, students should be asked to make predictions about their stress/chill levels, such as comparing evening versus morning stress, daily changes, weekend variations, and differences between groups. The Campaign Monitoring tool should be employed after the first day to track which students have collected the most data, encouraging participation and highlighting progress in this data-driven investigation."

    "title": "Technical Analysis, Permutations, and Simulations in Unit 2 Campaign 1",
    "body": "For Unit 2 Campaign 1, \"Stress/Chill,\" the technical analysis of collected data will be performed using RStudio, a powerful statistical software environment. This tool will be central to helping students process and interpret their stress/chill data, aligning with the campaign's core objectives. A primary objective of this campaign is for students to learn how to conduct and apply permutations. Permutations are crucial for modeling variability, allowing students to understand how data might fluctuate under different conditions and within and between groups. This method also forms the basis for performing informal inference, where students draw conclusions about populations based on sample data without strict distributional assumptions. Additionally, students will learn how to use simulations to make predictions about stress/chill levels and patterns. These analytical skills, supported by RStudio, are vital for students to achieve the campaign's objectives of comparing groups and understanding variability, leading to informed predictions and a comprehensive final report."

    "title": "Guiding Analytical Questions and Final Report Requirements for Unit 2 Campaign 1",
    "body": "In Unit 2 Campaign 1, \"Stress/Chill,\" students will be guided by a series of analytical questions to explore their collected data effectively using RStudio. These questions encourage critical thinking and data-driven insights. Students are prompted to generate and subsequently verify their predictions about stress patterns. They will investigate the typical stress/chill level of the entire class across the campaign duration, and then compare their individual typical stress/chill level to that of the class. Further analysis includes examining how stress/chill levels vary between weekdays and weekends, or depending on the type of people one is with. The campaign also encourages students to identify specific conditions that affect their stress/chill levels and, importantly, to formulate their own research questions for investigation, furthering their understanding of variability and inference. The culmination of this analytical work is the \"Stress/Chill Practicum\" report. In this report, students will synthesize their findings, applying the data analysis and RStudio skills acquired throughout the Unit to present a comprehensive analysis of their stress/chill data and address the campaign's objectives."
