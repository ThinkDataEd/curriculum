    "title": "Abstract: Unit 2 Lesson 13 - The Horror Movie Shuffle",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 13, titled 'The Horror Movie Shuffle,' aims to teach students that observed differences between groups can sometimes be attributed purely to chance, and these differences are typically small. The lesson focuses on understanding how to determine if outcomes for categorical variables are due to chance by calculating differences in proportions between two groups. Students learn key vocabulary such as chance, simulations, randomness, and shuffle. The core concept involves 'shuffling' categorical data and using the difference in proportions as a statistic. A distribution formed by shuffling represents what occurs if chance is the sole factor. If an actual observed difference in proportions aligns with the center of this shuffling distribution, chance is considered a good explanation. However, if the observed difference is extreme (in the tails or beyond the distribution), then chance is likely not the cause. The lesson uses a practical activity involving horror movie character survival data to simulate random outcomes and compare them to real-world observations. Students engage in a classroom simulation to physically shuffle survival outcomes, calculate differences in proportions, and visualize these results on a dotplot. This activity helps them discern if the observed 10% difference in survival rates between male and female horror movie characters is a 'real' phenomenon or merely a product of chance. The lesson concludes by connecting this hands-on experience to future computational methods, such as shuffling data in RStudio, and assigns data collection homework for the 'Unit 2 Campaign: Stress/Chill' and 'Unit 2 Lab 2E: The Horror Movie Shuffle'."

    "title": "Understanding Chance, Simulations, and Statistical Interpretation in Unit 2 Lesson 13",
    "body": "The primary objective of Unit 2 Lesson 13, 'The Horror Movie Shuffle,' is for students to grasp that differences observed between two groups can arise purely by chance, and that these chance-driven differences are usually minor. Students will specifically learn to determine if outcomes for categorical variables are attributable to chance by computing and analyzing differences in proportions between the two groups. Essential concepts underpin this lesson: we can 'shuffle' data based on categorical variables, and the statistic employed to measure group differences in this context is the difference in proportions. A distribution generated through repeated shuffling serves as a model for outcomes if only chance were influencing the results. By comparing an actual observed difference in proportions to this chance-generated distribution, students can draw conclusions. If the observed difference falls near the center of the shuffling distribution, it suggests chance adequately explains the difference. Conversely, if the observed difference is extreme (located in the tails or outside the range of the shuffled distribution), it indicates that chance is likely not the sole explanation. Key vocabulary introduced includes 'chance,' 'simulations' (creating random events mimicking real life), 'randomness' (happenings by chance, unpredictable), and 'shuffle' (rearranging elements into different random positions or order). This foundational understanding prepares students to critically evaluate observed differences in real-world data."

    "title": "Monitoring Data Collection and Distinguishing Real from Chance Differences",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 13, 'The Horror Movie Shuffle,' begins by engaging students with the IDS Campaign Monitoring Tool, accessible via the portal at https://portal.thinkdataed.org. By clicking 'Campaign Monitor' and signing in, students can observe real-time data collection metrics. This includes identifying top data collectors, monitoring the number of active and inactive users, reviewing daily response submissions, and understanding the proportion of shared versus private responses. These monitoring activities prompt students to reflect on strategies for increasing data collection. Following this, the lesson transitions to a crucial concept: understanding that perceived differences between groups may not always be 'real' but could instead be products of 'chance' or 'randomness.' Students recall their prior learning about 'chance' from Unit 2 Lesson 8, defining it as a 'possibility of something happening' (synonyms: possibility, prospect, expectation, unintentional, unplanned). The lesson explains that 'simulations' can be used to demonstrate how differences between groups sometimes occur solely due to chance, rather than signifying a meaningful distinction. Students are encouraged to brainstorm and record situations where two groups are compared (e.g., gender and earnings, athletic abilities, coin flip outcomes) and hypothesize whether the observed differences are real or merely due to chance. This sets the stage for learning methods to scientifically distinguish between the two."

    "title": "Analyzing Horror Movie Character Survival: Observed Data and Proportions",
    "body": "In Unit 2 Lesson 13, 'The Horror Movie Shuffle,' students delve into a specific dataset to explore the concept of chance versus real differences. The lesson uses data collected from 485 characters across 50 horror or slasher films, focusing on two categorical variables: Gender and Survival. Gender was recorded as 'Female' or 'Male,' and Survival as 'Dies' or 'Survives.' It's noted that the data source used gender in a binary manner. The observed distribution of characters and their survival outcomes is presented in a contingency table:\n\n|          | Gender |\n|----------|:------:|\n| Survival | Female | Male |\n| Dies     | 172    | 228  |\n| Survives | 50     | 35   |\n| Total    | 222    | 263  |\n\nThis table reveals that there were more male characters than female characters and that most characters, regardless of gender, do not survive. From this data, the proportion of survivors was calculated for each gender: for female characters, 50 out of 222 survived, approximately 23%; for male characters, 35 out of 263 survived, approximately 13%. The lesson then calculates the observed difference in these proportions: 23% - 13% = 10%. This means 10% more female characters survived than male characters in the actual films. Students are prompted to discuss if this 10% difference is 'big' or 'small' and whether it aligns with their initial expectations regarding survival likelihoods, setting up the need for a simulation to determine if this difference is statistically significant or merely due to chance."

    "title": "Shuffling Categorical Data to Model Chance and Interpret Differences",
    "body": "A central theme of Unit 2 Lesson 13, 'The Horror Movie Shuffle,' is the practical application of 'shuffling' categorical data to understand whether observed differences between groups are due to chance. The lesson reinforces the essential concept that when dealing with categorical variables, the 'difference in proportions' serves as the key statistic to compare groups. By repeatedly shuffling the data—effectively reassigning outcomes (like 'survives' or 'dies') randomly among different groups (like 'female' and 'male' characters)—a 'shuffling distribution' is created. This distribution precisely illustrates what the differences in proportions would look like if chance were the *only* factor at play, meaning there is no underlying real relationship between the categorical variables (e.g., gender and survival). Students learn to interpret the 'actual observed difference' (in the horror movie example, a 10% higher survival rate for females) by comparing it to this shuffling distribution. If the observed difference falls near the center of the shuffled distribution, it suggests that chance alone could easily account for the difference. However, if the observed difference is 'extreme'—meaning it lies far out in the 'tails' of the distribution or is 'off the charts'—then the conclusion is that chance is *not* a sufficient explanation, implying a real, non-random difference exists between the groups. The classroom activity is designed to perform this shuffling manually, allowing students to physically experience how randomness can generate varying differences in proportions and to determine if the 10% difference observed in horror movie survival data is 'big' enough to rule out chance."

    "title": "Classroom Simulation Setup: Assigning Roles and Expected Survival in Unit 2 Lesson 13",
    "body": "To actively explore the distinction between chance and real differences, Unit 2 Lesson 13, 'The Horror Movie Shuffle,' involves a hands-on classroom simulation. The class is divided into two groups, representing horror movie characters: one group comprising 46% of the students assigned to play 'female characters' and the other 54% assigned to play 'male characters,' regardless of their actual gender. This distribution reflects the observed proportions in the real horror movie dataset. Each group then calculates how many of their assigned characters would have 'survived' based on the actual observed survival proportions: 23% for female characters and 13% for male characters. For instance, in a class of 30, approximately 14 students would be 'female characters' (0.46 * 30), and about 3 of these (0.23 * 14) would be 'survivors.' The remaining 16 students would be 'male characters,' with about 2 of them (0.13 * 16) being 'survivors.' Students then receive 3\" x 5\" cards and write either 'dies' or 'survives' on them, corresponding to their assigned fate. A critical conceptual step is explaining that *if* there were truly no difference in survival likelihood between genders in horror movies, then any character's survival would be purely by chance. Students then calculate the total number and proportion of survivors in their class simulation (e.g., 5 survivors out of 30, or 17%) and ponder how many 'male' and 'female' survivors they would expect to see if survival were purely random and based on this overall class proportion, thereby setting the baseline for the shuffling activity."

    "title": "Executing the 'Horror Movie Shuffle' Simulation and Recording Outcomes",
    "body": "After assigning initial survival outcomes based on observed data, Unit 2 Lesson 13 proceeds with the core 'shuffle' activity. All 3\" x 5\" cards, each marked 'dies' or 'survives,' are collected from the students. The instructor visibly shuffles these cards thoroughly to create a truly random reassignment of survival outcomes. This randomization simulates a scenario where a character's 'gender' (as assigned to the student groups) has no bearing on their survival—it's purely by chance. The shuffled cards are then redistributed face down to the students. Once all cards are dealt, each of the 'female character' and 'male character' groups identifies how many within their group are now 'survivors' and calculates the corresponding proportion of survivors for their randomly assigned gender. On the board, a table is created to systematically record these outcomes. This table includes columns for the number of female survivors, number of male survivors, the calculated proportion of female survivors, the calculated proportion of male survivors, and crucially, the 'Difference in Proportions (Female – Male).' The first row of this table is pre-filled with the original, observed difference (e.g., 0.23 - 0.13 = 0.10). Students observe that the 'Difference in Proportions' can be positive or negative, as random chance can lead to either group having a higher or lower proportion of survivors in any given shuffle. A dotplot labeled 'Difference in Proportions' is drawn on the board, with a vertical line clearly marking the actual observed 10% difference from the real horror movie data. Each new difference in proportions generated by a shuffle is then added as a dot to this plot, visually building a distribution of chance outcomes."

    "title": "Interpreting Simulation Results: Distinguishing Real Differences from Chance",
    "body": "The 'Horror Movie Shuffle' activity in Unit 2 Lesson 13 emphasizes the critical process of interpreting the results of multiple simulations. After performing the shuffling and recording steps (Unit 2 Lesson 13, steps 19-24) several times, students are prompted to reflect on the emerging dotplot. Key questions include identifying the biggest and smallest differences in proportions observed from their shuffles. More importantly, students are asked to predict what the dotplot would look like if the survival cards were shuffled 1000 times. The expected answer is a roughly symmetric distribution centered around zero, signifying that if there truly were no relationship between gender and survival, the difference in proportions would typically hover around zero. The core of the lesson's conclusion lies in comparing this chance-generated distribution to the *actual* observed difference of 10% (female survivors – male survivors) from the horror movie data. Students discuss how rarely, if ever, a 10% difference is seen when survival is assigned purely by chance. This stark contrast leads to the conclusion that the 10% difference is likely *not* due to chance, suggesting that horror movies actually favor female survivors. Consequently, when asked which character gender they would prefer to be cast as in a horror movie, students can confidently state 'female,' supported by the evidence that female characters are statistically more likely to survive the film. This rigorous comparison highlights the power of simulations in distinguishing real-world effects from mere random variation."

    "title": "Consolidating Learning: Chance, Simulation, and Future Applications in Data Science",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 13, 'The Horror Movie Shuffle,' culminates in consolidating students' understanding of critical data science concepts. The lesson reinforces the idea that simulations are powerful tools for determining if an observed event or difference between groups is genuinely 'real' or simply attributable to 'chance' or 'randomness.' Students solidify their grasp of the 'difference in proportions' as the appropriate statistic for analyzing relationships between categorical variables after engaging with the horror movie survival data. They learn that by comparing an observed difference to a distribution generated by many random shuffles, they can infer whether the observed difference is likely due to an underlying factor (a 'real' difference) or if it falls within the expected range of variability from pure chance. The lesson specifically highlights that if the actual difference (e.g., 10% higher female survival in horror movies) rarely appears in the random shuffling distribution, it indicates a significant, non-random effect. This hands-on experience provides a concrete foundation for more advanced statistical reasoning. To bridge this conceptual understanding with practical computational skills, students are informed that they will learn how to perform similar shuffling analyses using RStudio. This prepares them for subsequent data science tasks where manual simulation is impractical. The lesson concludes by assigning homework, which includes collecting data for the 'Unit 2 Campaign: Stress/Chill' through the IDS ThinkData Ed App or web portal. Furthermore, students are required to complete 'Unit 2 Lab 2E: The Horror Movie Shuffle' before moving on to 'Unit 2 Lesson 14,' ensuring continued engagement with these essential concepts."

    "title": "Practical Data Monitoring, Key Vocabulary, and Upcoming Assignments",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 13, 'The Horror Movie Shuffle,' integrates practical data management with foundational statistical concepts. Students are guided to use the IDS Campaign Monitoring Tool at https://portal.thinkdataed.org, specifically accessing 'Campaign Monitor' to oversee data collection. This involves actively tracking engagement by identifying users with the most collected data, distinguishing between active and inactive users via a pie chart, monitoring the total responses submitted yesterday and today, and understanding the proportion of shared versus private responses through another pie chart. These exercises encourage students to critically think about increasing data collection efficiency. The lesson also explicitly defines essential vocabulary: 'chance' (the possibility of something happening), 'simulations' (creating random events that approximate real-life situations without actual execution), 'randomness' (happenings by chance, not predictable), and 'shuffle' (rearranging items into different random positions or order). These terms are integral to understanding the core concepts of the lesson. For continued learning and application, the lesson provides clear homework instructions: for the next five days, students must collect data for the 'Unit 2 Campaign: Stress/Chill' using either the IDS ThinkData Ed App or the web portal. Crucially, students are also instructed to complete 'Unit 2 Lab 2E: The Horror Movie Shuffle' prior to starting 'Unit 2 Lesson 14.' A 'Class Scribes' activity is also mentioned, where one student team summarizes the three most important topics of the day, reinforcing key takeaways."
