    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 12, titled 'Don't Take My Stress Away!', guides students through an exploration of personal stress and 'chill' levels using a Participatory Sensing campaign. The lesson begins by engaging students with the Huffington Post article *Don’t Take My Stress Away* to spark interest in how they spend their time and to foster critical reading skills regarding data-backed claims. Students utilize data collection devices to participate in the *Stress/Chill Campaign*, accessing it via the IDS ThinkData Ed App or a web portal. Key activities include familiarizing with campaign guidelines, discussing initial observations on stress, reading the article and noting reactions, and then actively collecting personal stress/chill data over six days at randomly generated times. The lesson emphasizes generating statistical questions from the collected data and making predictions. Essential concepts covered include the importance of statistical question generation in Participatory Sensing and how research informs campaign questions. Homework involves continued data collection, ensuring all students contribute to the Unit 2 Campaign Stress/Chill dataset."

    "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 12: Objectives and Critical Reading Skills",
    "body": "The primary objective of Unit 2 Lesson 12, 'Don't Take My Stress Away!', is for students to engage with the Huffington Post article *Don’t Take My Stress Away*. This reading serves a dual purpose: first, to stimulate student reflection on how they allocate their time, particularly in relation to stress and relaxation. Second, the lesson aims to enhance students' critical reading abilities, teaching them to scrutinize reports and identify claims that may or may not be substantiated by empirical data. By analyzing the article, students will develop a more discerning eye for information, a crucial skill for the subsequent data collection and analysis within the Unit 2 Campaign Stress/Chill. This unit helps students understand the initial steps of a Participatory Sensing campaign, which includes generating relevant statistical questions based on research and observations."

    "title": "Materials Required for Unit 2 Lesson 12: Initiating Data Collection",
    "body": "To successfully execute Unit 2 Lesson 12, 'Don't Take My Stress Away!', several key materials are indispensable. Students will need access to the Huffington Post article, *Don’t Take My Stress Away*, available online at [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jack-cahn/dont-take-my-stress-away_b_2090203.html](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jack-cahn/dont-take-my-stress-away_b_2090203.html). Data collection devices, such as mobile phones or computers, are essential for participating in the *Stress/Chill Campaign*. Furthermore, the lesson relies on the *Stress/Chill Campaign* guidelines, which are detailed in the `LMR_U2_Campaign_StressChill.pdf` document. These guidelines provide the framework and questions for the Participatory Sensing campaign, ensuring students understand how to generate statistical questions and collect meaningful data. These materials facilitate students' engagement in critical reading and hands-on data collection for the Unit 2 Campaign Stress/Chill."

    "title": "Essential Concepts: Statistical Question Generation in Participatory Sensing",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 12, 'Don't Take My Stress Away!', emphasizes two essential concepts foundational to data science and Participatory Sensing. Firstly, generating statistical questions is presented as the crucial initial step in any Participatory Sensing campaign. This process involves formulating questions that can be answered through data collection and analysis, rather than simple factual recall. Secondly, the lesson highlights that both thorough research and careful observations play a vital role in crafting applicable and insightful campaign questions. These concepts are directly applied in the Unit 2 Campaign Stress/Chill, where students will learn to formulate their own statistical questions based on their experiences and the data they collect. This intellectual framework ensures that the data collection, guided by the *Stress/Chill Campaign* guidelines, is purposeful and leads to meaningful insights."

    "title": "Introduction to the Unit 2 Campaign Stress/Chill and Initial Student Engagement",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lesson 12, 'Don't Take My Stress Away!', begins by familiarizing students with the *Stress/Chill Campaign* guidelines, especially focusing on the survey questions to prepare them for the upcoming data collection. Before diving into the core activities, students are prompted with discussion questions such as, 'Do you know anyone who seems to be always stressed or anyone who seems to be always chilled?' and 'What are some observations you have made that make that person extremely stressed or chilled?' These initial discussions serve to activate prior knowledge and observations, setting the stage for their personal involvement in the Unit 2 Campaign Stress/Chill. This participatory approach helps students connect the abstract concept of stress to tangible, observable behaviors and lay the groundwork for understanding the objectives of the *Stress/Chill Campaign*."

    "title": "Engaging with the 'Don't Take My Stress Away' Article and Personal Reflection",
    "body": "A significant component of Unit 2 Lesson 12, 'Don't Take My Stress Away!', involves students reading the Huffington Post article *Don’t Take My Stress Away*. This article, which features high school students who perceive stress as an integral part of life, is introduced to broaden students' perspectives on the topic. After providing the link ([http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jack-cahn/dont-take-my-stress-away_b_2090203.html](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jack-cahn/dont-take-my-stress-away_b_2090203.html)), students are given time to read it thoroughly. A critical task during reading is for students to document their agreement or disagreement with the authors' viewpoints, along with any personal comments or reactions, in their DS journals. This reflective practice is followed by a paired discussion and a class 'Share Out,' where students articulate their stances and justifications, fostering critical thinking about the narrative presented in the article and preparing them for the Unit 2 Campaign Stress/Chill."

    "title": "Implementing the Unit 2 Campaign Stress/Chill: Data Collection and Reminders",
    "body": "Following the article discussion in Unit 2 Lesson 12, 'Don't Take My Stress Away!', students transition to active data collection for the Unit 2 Campaign Stress/Chill. The lesson informs students that they will be investigating their own stress and 'chill' levels at various times of the day. Students are instructed to add the *Stress/Chill Campaign* to their available campaigns, which can be done either through the IDS ThinkData Ed App or via a web browser at [https://portal.thinkdataed.org](https://portal.thinkdataed.org). After completing their initial survey, a crucial step involves the teacher generating two random times daily for the subsequent six days for data collection. For instance, in RStudio, `sample(7:23, size = 2, replace = FALSE)` can generate times between 7:00 am and 11:00 pm. Students are then responsible for setting reminders for these specific times over the next six days, using mobile devices or other available methods, ensuring consistent data collection for the *Stress/Chill Campaign*."

    "title": "Formulating Statistical Questions and Predictions for Unit 2 Campaign Stress/Chill",
    "body": "A key intellectual task in Unit 2 Lesson 12, 'Don't Take My Stress Away!', involves students applying the essential concept of generating statistical questions. After familiarizing themselves with the *Stress/Chill Campaign* survey questions (often displayed from the Campaign Guidelines document), students are challenged to formulate three distinct statistical questions that could be effectively answered using the data they will collect from the Unit 2 Campaign Stress/Chill. This exercise reinforces the idea that research and observations help create applicable campaign questions. Following this, students are also required to document their predictions in their DS journals. These predictions should outline what they anticipate observing or discovering once they have gathered sufficient data, thereby fostering analytical thinking and hypothesis formation in anticipation of their personal data collection for the *Stress/Chill Campaign* over the next six days."
