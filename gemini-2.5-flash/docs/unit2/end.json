    "title": "Abstract: End of Unit 2 Project – Comparing Groups Using Our Own Data",
    "body": "This project, titled 'End of Unit 2 Project: Comparing Groups Using Our Own Data,' serves as the culminating activity for learning acquired in Unit 1 and Unit 2 of the curriculum. Students, collaborating with an assigned partner over a span of five days, are tasked with formulating and answering a statistical question. This question must involve a comparison between two distinct groups, utilizing at least one of the provided datasets, which include 'Food Habits,' 'Time Use,' 'Stress/Chill,' and 'Personality Color.' A critical aspect of the analysis is to determine whether any observed differences are statistically significant or merely due to chance, requiring the application of at least two methods such as data merging, creating simulations, calculating probabilities based on simulations, using a Normal model, or shuffling/permuting data. Deliverables for this project include a 4-slide, 5-minute presentation, with both partners participating, and a 2-4 page typed, double-spaced summary of their analysis. The project sequence progresses from question formulation and teacher approval on Day 1, through analytical work and presentation preparation on Days 2-3, concluding with presentations on Days 4-5. The primary material guiding this project is the LMR_U2_End_of_Unit_Project.pdf."

    "title": "End of Unit 2 Project: Objective and General Structure",
    "body": "The 'End of Unit 2 Project: Comparing Groups Using Our Own Data' is a significant design project located at the conclusion of Unit 2, intended for students to apply their cumulative learning from both Unit 1 and Unit 2 of the curriculum. Students will work collaboratively with an assigned partner to complete this project over a total of five days. The central objective is to pose and answer a statistical question that explicitly requires a comparison between two distinct groups. This inquiry must draw upon at least one of the provided datasets, which include 'Food Habits,' 'Time Use,' 'Stress/Chill,' and 'Personality Color.' A fundamental requirement for the analysis is to assess whether any observed differences between the compared groups are genuinely significant or could be simply attributed to random chance. The detailed guidelines and supporting materials for this project are found in the LMR_U2_End_of_Unit_Project.pdf document."

    "title": "Defining the Statistical Question for Unit 2 End Project",
    "body": "For the 'End of Unit 2 Project: Comparing Groups Using Our Own Data,' students, in their assigned partnerships, are responsible for developing a precise statistical question and subsequently answering it. This question is foundational to the entire project and must adhere to two core requirements: first, it must clearly involve a comparison between two distinct groups. Second, the subsequent analysis must thoroughly investigate whether any observed differences between these groups are statistically 'real' or could be merely the outcome of random chance. Students will select at least one from the available datasets—'Food Habits,' 'Time Use,' 'Stress/Chill,' or 'Personality Color'—to inform their statistical inquiry. The project spans 5 days, with the crucial first day dedicated to deciding on the statistical question and obtaining approval from the teacher to ensure alignment with project objectives."

    "title": "Key Statistical Methods for Unit 2 End Project Analysis",
    "body": "To effectively answer their statistical question within the 'End of Unit 2 Project: Comparing Groups Using Our Own Data,' students are mandated to utilize at least two specific analytical methods. These methods are critical for thoroughly investigating observed differences between groups and discerning if they are statistically significant or merely due to chance. The prescribed techniques from which students must choose include: merging data from various sources, creating simulations to model potential outcomes, calculating probabilities based on the results of these simulations, employing a Normal model for statistical inference, or shuffling/permuting data to test hypotheses. The project, designed to last 5 days, requires the application of these techniques to one of the provided datasets, such as 'Food Habits,' 'Time Use,' 'Stress/Chill,' or 'Personality Color,' thereby demonstrating comprehensive understanding of concepts from Unit 1 and Unit 2."

    "title": "Resources and Datasets for Unit 2 End Project",
    "body": "The 'End of Unit 2 Project: Comparing Groups Using Our Own Data' provides students with essential resources to successfully complete their analysis. The primary material that guides the entire project is the LMR_U2_End_of_Unit_Project.pdf document. For their statistical investigations, students are given a selection of four distinct datasets from which they must choose at least one: 'Food Habits,' 'Time Use,' 'Stress/Chill,' and 'Personality Color.' These datasets serve as the foundation for formulating and answering their statistical question, which must involve a comparison of two distinct groups. The project, a 5-day endeavor for assigned partners, requires not only the use of these datasets but also the application of at least two specific statistical methods to determine if observed differences are real or could be due to chance, thereby applying learning from Unit 1 and Unit 2."

    "title": "Presentation Requirements for Unit 2 End Project",
    "body": "A compulsory deliverable for the 'End of Unit 2 Project: Comparing Groups Using Our Own Data' is a formal presentation, which necessitates active participation from both assigned partners. This presentation is strictly limited to a maximum of 4 slides and should be delivered within approximately 5 minutes. The content of the presentation must clearly explain the rationale behind choosing their statistical question, highlighting why it is considered interesting. Students are also required to interpret and discuss supporting plots and numerical summaries that directly address and answer their statistical question. Furthermore, a crucial element of the presentation involves providing reasoned arguments on whether the observed statistical outcome might be attributable to random chance. This presentation, alongside a written summary, culminates the 5-day project, showcasing the application of learning from Unit 1 and Unit 2."

This document must be between 2 and 4 pages in length, typed, and double-spaced. It should meticulously detail their formulated statistical question, the specific datasets utilized (e.g., 'Food Habits,' 'Time Use,' 'Stress/Chill,' 'Personality Color'), the at least two statistical methods employed (e.g., merging data, creating simulations, calculating probabilities, Normal model, shuffling/permuting data), and their conclusions regarding whether observed differences between two distinct groups are statistically real or merely due to chance. This detailed summary complements the 5-minute presentation, providing an in-depth record of the 5-day project, which integrates and applies key learning from Unit 1 and Unit 2."
