    "title": "Abstract of Unit 2, Section 2: How Likely Is It?",
    "body": "This unit, designated \"Unit 2, Section 2: How Likely Is It?\", is a 7-day instructional segment designed to immerse students in the foundational concepts of probability. It establishes the enduring understanding that probability measures the long-run frequency of chance outcomes, which can be determined through both mathematical calculation and the design and execution of simulations. The learning experience is initiated with an engaging activity, where students analyze a scene from *Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead* depicting an improbable sequence of coin tosses, prompting a discussion on likelihood. Core learning objectives include mastering statistical concepts like independent events (S-CP 2), utilizing permutations for informal inference within data science contexts (S-CP 9), and critically evaluating data-based reports (S-IC 6). Data science objectives focus on understanding simulation algorithms. Applied computational thinking skills using RStudio are central, involving the design and conduct of simulations, comparison of actual versus simulated data, re-randomization of permuted data, and the derivation of theoretical probabilities from estimated samples. Real-world connections are forged by applying simulations to predict event expectations. Language objectives support communication through summary statements, Venn Diagrams for compound events, and group presentations explaining probability assessment via simulations. The unit primarily uses simulated data within RStudio, and a legend for activity icons is provided to guide students through the materials."

    "title": "Overview of Probability Concepts in Unit 2, Section 2",
    "body": "\"Unit 2, Section 2: How Likely Is It?\" is a comprehensive instructional segment spanning 7 days, dedicated to the study of probability. The central enduring understanding conveyed in this unit is that probability quantifies the long-run frequency of outcomes for random, chance events. Students are taught that these probabilities can be determined and approximated through two primary methods: by carefully designing and conducting simulations, or by applying mathematical calculations. The unit begins with an engaging activity that uses a dramatic scene from the movie *Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead*, where an extended sequence of identical coin toss results challenges intuitive notions of chance. This prompts students to discuss the extraordinary likelihood of such an event, setting a practical context for exploring the principles of probability. Throughout the unit, students will develop skills in RStudio for computational analysis and learn to connect abstract probabilistic theories to real-world expectations of events, thereby fostering a deep and applicable understanding of probability."
