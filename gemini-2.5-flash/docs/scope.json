    "title": "Unit 1: Foundations of Data and Argument Evaluation",
    "body": "Unit 1 introduces the expansive concept of “data,” moving beyond spreadsheets to include images, text, and GPS coordinates. It emphasizes that our increasingly data-centric world constantly generates data traces, from social media posts to shopping records. The unit highlights how these ubiquitous data are used to generate narratives in political forecasting, marketing, scientific research, and recommendation systems. Crucially, it distinguishes this broad view from traditional statistics’ focus on random sampling. Unit 1 also motivates students to analyze and evaluate data and data products (charts, graphs, statistics) as critically as journalistic arguments, questioning data collection methods, creator bias, and underlying processes. This includes understanding how data representation embeds creator decisions. The recurring Common Core State Standard S-IC 6, “Evaluate reports based on data,” is woven throughout the entire course, starting in Unit 1."

    "body": "In Unit 1, students begin to construct multiple views of data using descriptive statistics to uncover insights. This foundational work involves learning the computational tool R through the RStudio interface. Key graphical displays, such as histograms and scatterplots, are introduced and created in RStudio, alongside measures of center and spread. The unit aligns with CCSS-M standards, including S-ID 1 (Represent data with plots like dotplots, histograms, boxplots), S-ID 2 (Use statistics to compare center of data sets, with spread studied later), S-ID 3 (Interpret differences in shape, center, and spread, accounting for outliers), S-ID 5 (Summarize categorical data in two-way frequency tables, interpret relative frequencies, and recognize associations), and S-ID 6 (Represent two quantitative variables on a scatterplot and describe relationships). Students will also develop skills in constructing viable arguments (SMP-3) and using appropriate tools strategically (SMP-5). A core learning objective for Unit 1 is to load data, create basic plots, and frequency tables in RStudio."

They will be able to provide examples of personal data traces and comprehend that rows and columns form a fundamental data structure. A critical skill developed is explaining the relationships (or lack thereof) between variables. Students will construct and interpret frequency tables and critically evaluate media reports based on data, identifying confounding factors in plots and interpreting axes and trends. They will calculate conditional and marginal probabilities from frequency tables and offer real-world explanations for these probabilities using critical thinking. Communication skills are emphasized, enabling students to convey their evaluations in written or verbal forms using various media. Computationally, students will master loading data into RStudio, creating basic plots, and generating frequency tables, laying the groundwork for more advanced data analysis.

    "title": "Unit 2: Probability, Simulation, and Introduction to Models",
    "body": "Unit 2 builds upon the informal reasoning skills from Unit 1 by introducing formal probability concepts as a tool to discern “real” patterns from random occurrences in data. Unlike traditional courses, this unit develops understanding through designing and implementing simulations using pseudo-random number generators, thereby fostering computational thinking and basic programming structures. The focus shifts to models, specifically linear models, which are a cornerstone of introductory statistics. These linear models will serve as a basis for more complex computer-aided modeling techniques introduced later in the course, such as smoothing and tree-based models. A key CCSS-M standard for Unit 2 is S-IC 2, which involves deciding if a specified model is consistent with results from a data-generating process, often using simulation. The recurring standard S-IC 6, “Evaluate reports based on data,” continues to be a central theme.

    "title": "Unit 2: Deepening Statistical Vocabulary and Probability",
    "body": "This unit refines students' technical vocabulary and analytical tools, deepening the informal reasoning developed in Unit 1. It focuses on using statistics appropriate to data distribution shapes to compare center (median, mean) and spread (interquartile range, standard deviation) of data sets (S-ID 2). Students learn to interpret these differences, accounting for outliers (S-ID 3). The normal distribution is introduced, fitting data to it using mean and standard deviation to estimate population percentages, while also recognizing its limitations (S-ID 4). Formal probability is explored, specifically understanding independent events where P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) (S-CP 2), and using permutations for informal inference in the context of data science (S-CP 9). Computational thinking is advanced through activities like designing and implementing simulations using pseudo-random number generators. These simulations are crucial for determining if observed data patterns are genuinely significant or merely random variations. Students utilize RStudio to simulate normal distributions and compare real data to simulations to determine consistency, reinforcing the practical application of these concepts."
