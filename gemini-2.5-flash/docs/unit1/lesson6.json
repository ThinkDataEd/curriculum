    "title": "Abstract: Unit 1 Lesson 6 - What Do I Eat?",
    "body": "This lesson plan for Unit 1 Lesson 6, titled \"What Do I Eat?\", guides students through the crucial Data Collection phase of the Data Cycle. The primary objective is for students to collect and manage data using traditional paper-and-pencil methods, thereby experiencing firsthand the inherent challenges associated with organizing, storing, and sharing information. A core learning outcome is the recognition that establishing a consensus on the variables to be recorded is essential for achieving data consistency and comparability. The lesson commences with a motivational video from Jamie Oliver's *Food Revolution*, prompting reflection on dietary choices and connecting to the prompt \"Why should I care about what I eat?\". Subsequent activities involve students collecting data from Nutrition Facts labels, initially individually, then comparing their diverse datasets in teams to highlight variations in collected variables and data structures. This leads to the introduction of a standardized *Food Habits Data Collection* handout (LMR_U1_L6_B), which facilitates agreement on variable identifiers. The lesson reinforces the importance of consistent data recording, building upon prior activities like the *Stick Figures* activity from Unit 1 Lesson 2. The lesson concludes by assigning homework where students formulate three statistical questions (summary, comparison, association) based on their newly collected and structured food habit data, preparing them for further data analysis and the use of mobile devices in the next class for the ongoing *Food Habits* campaign. The vocabulary term `dataset(s)` is also introduced."

    "body": "Unit 1 Lesson 6, \"What Do I Eat?\", kicks off by explicitly informing students that the session will concentrate on the Data Collection phase, a vital component of the overarching Data Cycle. To inject motivation and underscore the real-world relevance of data, the lesson features a compelling video segment from Jamie Oliver’s *Food Revolution*. This specific episode, lasting approximately 5-6 minutes and found at [https://youtu.be/I0vYwqkoktM](https://youtu.be/I0vYwqkoktM), showcases a Los Angeles high school setting. As students watch, they are instructed to actively engage with the content by recording their comments and emotional reactions in their Data Science (DS) journals. Following this visual stimulus, a crucial reflection point is presented: students must individually respond in their DS journals to the question, \"Why should I care about what I eat?\". This personal reflection is then broadened into a collaborative \"Silent Discussion,\" an instructional strategy where student teams share and interact with each other's responses without verbalizing, fostering deeper engagement and diverse perspectives on the topic. This initial phase of Unit 1 Lesson 6 is designed not only to introduce data collection but also to highlight the social and personal impact that data, particularly around nutrition, can reveal, preparing students for subsequent individual and team-based data gathering activities."

    "title": "Individual Food Data Collection and Team Comparison in Unit 1 Lesson 6",
    "body": "In Unit 1 Lesson 6, \"What Do I Eat?\", students transition from passive observation to active data collection, drawing a parallel with the *Stick Figures* activity from Unit 1 Lesson 2, where they gathered data about others. This lesson, however, shifts the focus to self-reflection and personal data, specifically about the foods they consume. Students are expected to bring Nutrition Facts labels from food items or snacks consumed at home. For those who may have forgotten, the *Nutrition Facts Cutouts* handout (LMR_U1_L6_A) is provided as a crucial resource to ensure all students can participate. Individually, students spend 3-5 minutes meticulously collecting any available data from these labels and recording it in their DS journals. This initial, unstructured data collection aims to highlight the variability and challenges inherent in raw data. Following this, students are prompted to compare and contrast their newly formed `datasets` with their team members, specifically addressing how their datasets are both similar and different. This comparative exercise is designed to surface the inconsistencies in variable selection and data structure when individuals independently decide what information to record, thereby demonstrating the practical challenges of organizing, storing, and sharing data without a unified approach."

    "title": "Addressing Data Inconsistencies through Standardization in Unit 1 Lesson 6",
    "body": "A critical phase in Unit 1 Lesson 6, \"What Do I Eat?\", involves students confronting the inconsistencies that arise from individual data collection. After comparing their individually gathered Nutrition Facts `datasets` in teams, the class reconvenes for a whole group discussion. During this discussion, the instructor explicitly draws out observations highlighting that while some facts were commonly collected, others were unique to certain students, and significant differences existed in the chosen variables and their data structures. This directly illustrates the challenges of organizing, storing, and sharing data without a predetermined framework. To underscore the need for better data presentation, students are then asked to complete an individual \"Quickwrite\" reflecting on: \"How can the data you just gathered be quickly displayed and easily read?\". The solution to these challenges is introduced through the distribution of the *Food Habits Data Collection* handout (LMR_U1_L6_B). This handout serves as a standardized template, which students use to record their initial label observations and subsequently track foods/snacks consumed during the ongoing *Food Habits* campaign. The structured format of this handout directly addresses the objective of establishing agreement on variables to attain data consistency, moving students towards more organized and usable `datasets`."

    "body": "Following the standardization of data collection using the *Food Habits Data Collection* handout (LMR_U1_L6_B) in Unit 1 Lesson 6, \"What Do I Eat?\", students proceed to a crucial step: defining variables. In pairs, they are tasked with assigning a concise, one-word identifier to each variable present in their collected data, for example, identifying \"What's the name of your snack?\" as simply \"Name.\" This exercise reinforces the concept of structuring `datasets` and preparing them for analysis. A \"Team Whip Around\" instructional strategy is then employed, allowing teams to quickly share their proposed one-word variable identifiers with the entire class, fostering a collective understanding and agreement on standardized terminology. As the lesson concludes, homework is assigned, requiring students to examine the data they've meticulously collected in their *Food Habits Data Collection* handout (LMR_U1_L6_B). Based on this data, they must formulate three distinct statistical questions—specifically, one summary question, one comparison question, and one association question—that they believe can be answered by the *Food Habits* data. This assignment bridges data collection with the initial stages of data analysis and question formulation within the Data Cycle. Furthermore, students are informed that they are permitted, and encouraged, to bring mobile devices to the next class, signaling a transition to more advanced data collection methods for the ongoing *Food Habits* campaign."
