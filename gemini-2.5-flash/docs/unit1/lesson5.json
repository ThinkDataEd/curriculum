    "title": "Abstract: Developing Good Statistical Questions in Unit 1 Lesson 5",
    "body": "Unit 1 Lesson 5, titled 'So Many Questions,' focuses on teaching students the features of a good statistical question. The lesson emphasizes that developing a precise statistical question is an iterative process, evolving from vague general inquiries. Key concepts include understanding what makes a question statistical (addressing variability and being answerable with data) and distinguishing it from non-statistical or survey questions. Students learn Dr. Pip Arnold's six features of a good statistical question, which cover clarity of variables and population, data answerability, focus on the whole group, clear intention (summary, comparison, association, time series), and relevance. The lesson involves hands-on activities where students create and refine statistical questions using provided stick figure data, sorting them by type (summary, comparison, association). It includes examples of transforming initial questions into well-formulated ones by applying the learned criteria. Materials like Post-its and the 'Statistical Questions Scenarios' handout (LMR_U1_L5) are used. The lesson concludes with preparations for Unit 1 Lesson 6, where students will begin collecting 'Nutrition Facts' labels for an upcoming activity on food habits, reinforcing the practical application of data collection and inquiry."

    "title": "Essential Concepts: Features of a Good Statistical Question in Unit 1 Lesson 5",
    "body": "In Unit 1 Lesson 5, students delve into the essential concepts surrounding statistical questions, which are fundamental to data science. The lesson highlights that the process of creating a good statistical question is iterative, requiring time and effort to transition from a general idea to a precise inquiry. A core reference is Dr. Pip Arnold's 2021 paper, 'What Makes a Good Statistical Question,' which identifies six crucial features. These features include:\n(1) The variable(s) of interest must be clear.\n(2) The group or population of interest needs to be clearly defined.\n(3) The question must be answerable with the available data.\n(4) It should ask about the whole group, not just an individual.\n(5) The intention must be clear, categorizing the question as a summary, comparison, association, or time series inquiry.\n(6) The question should be worthwhile, interesting, and serve a purpose.\nIt is noted that statisticians and data scientists may interchangeably refer to these as 'statistical investigative questions.' Students also recall that statistical questions address variability and can be answered with data, a concept reinforced through the initial activities of Unit 1 Lesson 5, building on prior knowledge."

    "title": "Defining and Differentiating Statistical Questions in Unit 1 Lesson 5",
    "body": "Unit 1 Lesson 5 focuses on clearly defining statistical questions and distinguishing them from other types of questions. A statistical question is characterized by its ability to address variability and be answered with data. The core test for identifying one is: 'Do we need to see the data to answer the question?' The lesson uses examples from a previous lesson to illustrate this distinction: 'How old are you?' (not statistical, as it has only one possible value for an individual, lacking variability) versus 'How old are the students in my school?' (statistical, as student ages vary, introducing variability in data). Through pair activities and class discussions, students analyze these examples to grasp the concept of variability. The lesson also differentiates between statistical questions and survey questions. While survey questions (e.g., 'What is your GPA?') are asked to collect raw data, statistical questions are inquiries posed *of* that collected data (e.g., 'What is the typical GPA of students in my school?'). Understanding the exact survey questions used for data collection is crucial before formulating statistical questions, as demonstrated with the stick figure data where the meaning of a 'ball' image for 'sport' needed clarification."

    "title": "Creating and Classifying Statistical Questions from Data in Unit 1 Lesson 5",
    "body": "In Unit 1 Lesson 5, students actively engage in creating statistical questions using provided data, specifically about stick figures with attributes like name, GPA, friends, sport, height, and shoe type. After an entrance slip on the Data Cycle and recalling the definition of a statistical question, students work in teams. They are prompted with the sentence stem 'I wonderâ€¦' to generate initial statistical questions that could be answered using the stick figure data. Subsequently, teams identify and circle the variable(s) being investigated within their questions. This leads to a sorting activity where questions are organized on the board: those incorporating only one variable on the left, and those with two or more variables on the right. This practical exercise serves to introduce and help students distinguish between different types of statistical questions:\n*   **Summary statistical questions** focus on a single variable (e.g., 'How many friends do this group of stick figures have?').\n*   **Comparison statistical questions** compare a numerical variable across different groups (e.g., 'Is there a difference in the typical number of friends based on the sport played?').\n*   **Association statistical questions** explore relationships between paired numerical or paired categorical variables (e.g., 'Do stick figures who play soccer tend to have more friends than those who play tennis?'). This activity builds foundational understanding for the subsequent refinement process."

    "title": "Refining Statistical Questions Using Defined Criteria in Unit 1 Lesson 5",
    "body": "A key component of Unit 1 Lesson 5 involves students transforming their initial, often vague, statistical questions into well-formed ones by applying the six features of a good statistical question identified by Dr. Pip Arnold. This iterative process is demonstrated through class examples, first with a summary statistical question. An initial question like 'I wonder... Who has the most friends?' is analyzed against each criterion. For instance, the population (the stick figures) is clarified, and the question is reworded to address the whole group rather than an individual. The outcome is a refined question such as 'How many friends does this group of stick figures have?'\n\nThe same rigorous application of criteria is then extended to comparison and association questions. For an initial question like 'I wonder... Does someone who plays a specific sport have more friends?', the process involves clarifying variables, ensuring it refers to the whole group, and making the intention explicit (e.g., comparing groups). This leads to refined questions like 'Is there a difference in the typical number of friends the stick figures have based on the sport they play?' or 'Do the stick figures who play soccer tend to have more friends than the stick figures who play tennis?'. Student teams then apply this process to modify their own statistical questions, with facilitators guiding them through each criterion, fostering a deeper understanding of what constitutes a robust statistical inquiry. This hands-on refinement activity is crucial for students to internalize the features of a good statistical question."

    "title": "Practice, Redundancy, and Preparation for Unit 1 Lesson 6",
    "body": "Unit 1 Lesson 5 reinforces the understanding of statistical questions through structured practice and prepares students for subsequent lessons. After initial team work, selected Reporters share their revised statistical questions with the class. Audience members provide feedback, ensuring a collaborative and iterative learning environment where disagreements are discussed to solidify understanding of the criteria for good statistical questions. For additional practice, students use the 'Statistical Questions Scenarios' handout (LMR_U1_L5), which can be completed in groups or individually for homework. This handout provides scenarios to identify types of statistical questions (summary, comparison, association) and practice rewriting them to meet the established criteria. The lesson also introduces the upcoming focus for Unit 1 Lesson 6: 'Learning About Food Habits.' To prepare, students are assigned homework to collect at least two 'Nutrition Facts' labels from foods or snacks they typically eat, or print them from online sources. This task bridges the current lesson's focus on question formulation with future data collection and analysis activities within the broader curriculum, demonstrating the practical application of statistical inquiry in real-world contexts, and ensuring the learned concepts are applied to new datasets."
