    "title": "Core Concepts: The Ubiquitous Nature and Role of Data",
    "body": "Unit 1, Section 1, \"Data Are All Around,\" establishes several enduring understandings over 7 instructional days. A primary concept is that data plays a crucial and ever-present role in our daily lives. The act of organizing data is highlighted as a fundamental process, enabling students to gather conclusive evidence about real-life events and the individuals involved. This section also delves into the inherent characteristic of data collected from surveys, noting that such data inherently produces variability. To effectively comprehend this variability, students will learn to utilize distributions, various types of graphs, and plots as essential tools for organizing and visualizing data. Furthermore, the curriculum defines statistical questions as those specifically designed to address people, processes, and/or events that inherently contain variability. The unit also introduces the idea that while situations often involve complex variability, they can frequently be simplified and better understood through the application of basic statistical methods. This foundational understanding prepares students to engage with data in a meaningful and analytical way. The Target Story is used to introduce the idea that data are ubiquitous, highlighting the pervasive presence of data in contemporary society, a concept reinforced throughout this Unit 1, Section 1."

    "title": "Statistical and Mathematical Skills: Representing and Interpreting Data (S-ID) and Mathematical Practices",
    "body": "Within Unit 1, Section 1, \"Data Are All Around,\" a core focus is on developing specific statistical and mathematical learning objectives, primarily aligned with the S-ID standards. Students will learn to summarize, represent, and interpret data that pertains to a single count or measurement variable. A key objective, S-ID 1, instructs students on how to represent data visually using various plots on the real number line. These include dotplots, histograms, bar plots, and boxplots, providing a comprehensive toolkit for data visualization. Furthermore, S-ID 2 focuses on teaching students to use appropriate statistics to compare the center of two or more different data sets. This involves utilizing measures such as the median and mean, although the broader concept of measures of spread will be explored in Unit 2. The curriculum also addresses S-ID 6, which requires students to represent data involving two quantitative variables on a scatterplot. Beyond mere representation, students will also learn to describe and interpret how these variables are related, fostering an understanding of bivariate relationships. These objectives are crucial for students to grasp how data can be systematically organized and interpreted to reveal underlying patterns and insights. The use of various plots and statistical measures helps in understanding variability present in data collected from surveys and real-life events. Additionally, this Unit 1, Section 1, like all of Unit 1, emphasizes the Focus Standards for Mathematical Practice: SMP-3, to construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others, and SMP-5, to use appropriate tools strategically."

    "title": "Data Science Skills: Handling, Organizing, and Interpreting Diverse Data",
    "body": "The Unit 1, Section 1, \"Data Are All Around,\" curriculum places significant emphasis on developing practical data science skills over its 7 instructional days. Students will gain experience in handling ubiquitous data, learning how to manage and process the vast amount of information present in their daily lives. A fundamental skill taught is organizing data effectively, primarily utilizing rectangular or spreadsheet formats as robust data storage structures. This practical approach allows students to structure information systematically. The unit also makes students aware that everyday activities can be meticulously observed and recorded, thereby transforming into valuable data. A critical distinction students will learn is the difference between various plots used for categorical variables versus those used for numerical variables, enabling them to choose appropriate visualization methods. Consequently, a key objective is to interpret and understand graphs of distributions for both numerical and categorical variables, which is essential for making sense of data. These skills are crucial for understanding the variability inherent in data collected from answering survey questions and observing real-life events. The ability to differentiate between plot types and interpret distributions directly supports the enduring understanding that distributions, graphs, and plots are useful tools for organizing data to understand variability and answer statistical questions."

One key objective is to foster effective teamwork, acknowledging that data science often involves collaborative efforts. Students will learn to explain how data, information, and knowledge are represented for computational use, understanding the underlying structures that enable digital processing. A hands-on experience involves collecting, uploading, and sharing personal data through the Unit 1 Campaign Participatory Sensing. This activity provides practical exposure to real-world data collection methodologies and introduces students to sharing data in a structured, ethical manner. Furthermore, students will learn about different representations of distributions using software, moving beyond manual plotting to leverage computational tools for visualization. They will also begin to utilize software, specifically RStudio, to analyze plots of data that they have collected themselves via Participatory Sensing. This objective directly supports the learning objective of interpreting and understanding graphs of distributions for various variables, enhancing their analytical capabilities. The Unit 1 Campaign Food Habits Participatory Sensing is a specific example where students will collect data about their snacking habits using these computational tools, reinforcing the practical application of their RStudio skills and connecting data collection to their own lives."
