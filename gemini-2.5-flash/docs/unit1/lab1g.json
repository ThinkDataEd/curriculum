    "body": "This lab, Unit 1 Lab 1G titled \"What's the FREQ?\", guides participants through understanding and creating frequency tables for categorical variables using pre-loaded ATU survey data. Building on prior data cleaning concepts from Unit 1 Lab 1F, the lab emphasizes the inadequacy of averages for categorical data and introduces one-way frequency tables for simple counts. A significant portion focuses on two-way frequency tables, which allow for comparisons between two categorical variables, such as `sex` and `phys_challenge`. Participants learn to use the `tally()` function, visualize data with `bargraph()`, and interpret results, moving from raw counts to percentages using the `format = \"percent\"` option to account for unequal group sizes. The lab also distinguishes between different conditional relative frequencies (e.g., `variable1 | variable2` vs. `variable2 | variable1`) and explains how `R` calculates these by column. Advanced options like `margins = TRUE` are covered to display totals. Finally, \"On your own\" exercises challenge learners to describe the behavior of two-way tables with numerical and categorical variables, differentiate investigative questions for one-way versus two-way tables, and apply their knowledge to a new scenario involving part-time employment."

    "title": "Introduction to Unit 1 Lab 1G: Setup and Data Preparation",
    "body": "Unit 1 Lab 1G, titled \"What's the FREQ?\", serves as a practical guide for analyzing categorical data through the creation and interpretation of frequency tables. Learners are instructed to follow accompanying slides, answering questions highlighted in blue directly on their computers and questions highlighted in red within their personal journals. This lab builds upon foundational concepts introduced in Unit 1 Lab 1F, where participants learned to clean data for easier analysis. For the sake of consistency and to allow learners to focus on frequency table concepts, Unit 1 Lab 1G utilizes a pre-loaded dataset. A crucial initial task in this lab (Question 1) requires participants to write and execute R code using the `data()` function to load the `atu_clean` data file, ensuring a standardized dataset for all subsequent analytical exercises."

    "title": "Summarizing Categorical Variables with One-Way Frequency Tables",
    "body": "When working with categorical variables, such as 'orange', 'apple', or 'banana', it is not possible to calculate a meaningful average to describe a 'typical' value. Instead, Unit 1 Lab 1G introduces the concept of frequency tables as the appropriate method to summarize such data numerically. A frequency table functions by simply counting or tallying how often each distinct category appears within a dataset. To illustrate this, the lab provides an exercise (Question 2) challenging participants to fill in a `tally()` function template – `tally(~ ____, data = ____)` – to determine the difference in the number of females versus males present in the pre-loaded `atu_clean` American Time Use survey data. This exercise establishes the basic utility of one-way frequency tables for understanding the distribution of a single categorical variable."

    "title": "Foundations of Frequency Tables: Counting and Tallying Data",
    "body": "Unit 1 Lab 1G emphasizes that the fundamental way to summarize categorical variables is through counting or tallying. Unlike numerical data where averages are common, categorical data requires a different approach to numerical description. Frequency tables provide this by enumerating how often each specific category occurs within a dataset. For instance, to ascertain simple counts, the `tally()` function is introduced with a basic structure like `tally(~ variable_name, data = your_data)`. A practical application of this is presented in Question 2, where learners must write and run code to calculate how many more females than males are present in the `atu_clean` dataset. This task reinforces the core principle of one-way frequency tables: to count the occurrences of categories for a single variable, forming the basis for more complex analyses."

  {
    "title": "Introducing Two-Way Frequency Tables for Variable Comparisons",
    "body": "While one-way frequency tables are useful for summarizing a single categorical variable, Unit 1 Lab 1G highlights that data analysis often requires comparing relationships between *two* categorical variables. For example, a common investigative question might be: \"Does one `sex` seem to have a higher occurrence of physical challenges than the other?\" To initially visualize such relationships, the lab suggests using a split `bargraph`, demonstrating with the code `bargraph(~phys_challenge | sex, data = atu_clean)`. Although this plot provides a general idea, it lacks the precision needed for definitive answers. Therefore, the lab transitions to introducing two-way frequency tables as a more precise method. Participants are guided towards using an extended form of the `tally()` function, similar to how plots are faceted, to obtain exact counts and begin making comparisons between two variables."

  {
    "title": "Constructing and Documenting Two-Way Frequency Tables",
    "body": "Unit 1 Lab 1G progresses from visualizing categorical relationships to precisely quantifying them using two-way frequency tables. After using a `bargraph()` to get a general sense of the relationship between `phys_challenge` and `sex`, the lab instructs learners on how to obtain precise numerical values. Question 3 guides participants to write and execute a line of code using the `tally()` function, structured similarly to how plots are faceted (e.g., `tally(~ variable1 | variable2, data = your_data)`), to produce a two-way frequency table showing the number of people with physical challenges categorized by their sex. Following this, Question 4 explicitly requires participants to write down the resulting table, solidifying their understanding of how these tables are generated and their structure, preparing them for detailed interpretation."

    "title": "Interpreting Two-Way Tables: From Counts to Percentages for Fair Comparison",
    "body": "Unit 1 Lab 1G explains that simply using raw counts in two-way frequency tables can be misleading, especially when the total numbers in the groups being compared are unequal. For instance, if there are significantly more women than men in the dataset (as noted, 1153 more women in the ATU data), women might naturally show higher counts for physical challenges, irrespective of a true higher *rate*. To overcome this bias and enable a fair comparison, the lab introduces the use of percentages instead of raw counts. Participants are instructed to include `format = \"percent\"` as an option in their `tally()` code to convert counts to percentages. Question 5 then challenges learners to apply this option and interpret whether one `sex` truly has a higher occurrence of physical challenges based on these percentages, requiring them to explain their reasoning and highlight the value of relative frequencies."

  {
    "title": "Advanced Two-Way Tables: Incorporating Totals and Percentage Interpretation",
    "body": "To further enhance the clarity and interpretability of two-way frequency tables, Unit 1 Lab 1G introduces the option to display totals. By including `margins = TRUE` as an option within the `tally()` function, participants can easily view the row and column totals, which provides a comprehensive overview of the data distribution. This feature complements the use of percentages, which, as previously discussed in the lab, are crucial for making unbiased comparisons between groups of unequal sizes. When `format = \"percent\"` is applied alongside `margins = TRUE`, the resulting table offers a powerful tool to accurately assess relationships between categorical variables, allowing learners to discern true differences in occurrence rates, such as between different sexes and physical challenges, without being skewed by raw count discrepancies."

    "title": "Conditional Relative Frequencies: Understanding Positional Differences in `tally()`",
    "body": "Unit 1 Lab 1G highlights a critical distinction in constructing two-way frequency tables: the order of variables in the `tally()` function matters for conditional relative frequencies. There is a significant difference between `tally(~phys_challenge | sex, data = atu_clean, margin = TRUE)` and `tally(~sex | phys_challenge, data = atu_clean, margin = TRUE)`. While the raw count tables might look similar initially, especially without margins, the calculated totals for rows and columns will differ. The lab explicitly states that `R` calculates conditional frequencies by column. This means that in the first example (`~phys_challenge | sex`), the groups being compared are `Male` and `Female` based on the distribution of physical challenges within each sex, whereas in the second example (`~sex | phys_challenge`), the groups being compared are individuals with `No difficulty` and those that `Has difficulty` based on the distribution of sex within each difficulty group."

    "title": "Interpreting Conditional Percentages and Column-Wise Calculations",
    "body": "Building on the concept that `R` calculates conditional frequencies by column, Unit 1 Lab 1G delves deeper into the interpretation of these calculations when percentages are involved. The lab explains that for an expression like `tally(~phys_challenge | sex, data = atu_clean, margin = TRUE)`, when `format = \"percent\"` is added, the percentages are calculated down each column. This means that for the 'Male' column, the percentages represent the proportion of males who have 'No difficulty' versus 'Has difficulty', and similarly for the 'Female' column. Question 6 specifically tasks participants with adding `format = \"percent\"` to the `tally(~phys_challenge | sex, ...)` function and then interpreting both *how* the percents were calculated (i.e., column-wise) and *what they mean* in terms of the distribution of physical challenges within each sex group. This reinforces understanding of how `tally()` options affect output interpretation."
  },
  {
    "title": "Applying and Interpreting Conditional Relative Frequencies with Percentages",
    "body": "Unit 1 Lab 1G further solidifies the understanding of conditional relative frequencies by focusing on their application with percentages. When `format = \"percent\"` is applied to `tally(~phys_challenge | sex, data = atu_clean, margin = TRUE)`, the percentages displayed within the table reflect the proportion of each `phys_challenge` category *within* each `sex` group. For example, the percentage for 'Has difficulty' within the 'Male' column indicates the rate of physical challenges *among males*. This column-wise percentage calculation is crucial for accurately comparing whether males or females have a higher *rate* or *likelihood* of experiencing physical challenges, rather than just higher raw counts. This precise interpretation of conditional percentages allows learners to make informed conclusions regarding the comparative prevalence of physical challenges between genders, directly addressing the lab's investigative questions with robust statistical evidence."

    "title": "On Your Own: Exploring Table Behavior and Differentiating Question Types",
    "body": "Unit 1 Lab 1G concludes with a section of \"On your own\" exercises designed to deepen understanding and encourage critical thinking beyond the core examples. Question 7 challenges participants to explore the behavior of a two-way frequency table when one variable is numerical and the other is categorical. This prompts learners to consider the limitations or alternative interpretations that might arise from such a combination, contrasting it with the primary focus on two categorical variables. Following this, Question 8 asks participants to differentiate the types of statistical investigative questions that can be answered by one-way frequency tables versus two-way frequency tables. This exercise reinforces the distinct purposes of each table type: one-way tables describe the distribution of a single variable, while two-way tables explore relationships and associations between two variables, highlighting their respective strengths in data analysis."

    "title": "On Your Own: Applying Two-Way Tables to Employment and Consolidating Learning",
    "body": "The final \"On your own\" exercise in Unit 1 Lab 1G, Question 9, provides a practical application of the two-way frequency table skills learned throughout the lab. Participants are tasked with determining which `sex` has a higher rate of *part-time employment*, requiring them to set up and interpret a new two-way frequency table using the `atu_clean` dataset. This task serves as a comprehensive assessment of their ability to correctly apply the `tally()` function, including options like `format = \"percent\"` and potentially `margins = TRUE`, to draw conclusions from real-world data. This final exercise, alongside the earlier ones, consolidates the key learning objectives of Unit 1 Lab 1G: understanding how to summarize categorical variables, distinguishing between one-way and two-way tables, effectively using percentages for comparison, and interpreting conditional relative frequencies to answer specific investigative questions."
