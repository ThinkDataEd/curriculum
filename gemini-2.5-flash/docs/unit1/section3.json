    "body": "This document outlines Unit 1, Section 3, titled \"Would You Look at the Time!\", designed for 9 instructional days. The core enduring understanding is that data is essential for evaluating claims and reports, with summaries of categorical and numerical data revealing important patterns and providing evidence for claims. Students will engage with an interactive graphic, \"How Men and Women Spend Their Days,\" from Nathan Yau, utilizing data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). This engagement aims to spark curiosity about personal time-use. Learning objectives span statistical/mathematical concepts (summarizing two-category categorical data in two-way frequency tables, interpreting relative frequencies—joint, marginal, conditional, recognizing associations, and evaluating data-based reports), data science principles (understanding data formats and cleaning), and applied computational thinking using RStudio (creating tabular displays, two-way frequency tables, calculating various relative frequencies, subsetting data frames, creating new categorical variables, and data cleaning). Real-world connections focus on making and evaluating data-based claims. Language objectives include describing associations, connecting personal time-use to national trends, and reading informative texts to evaluate data-based claims. Data files include students' Time-Use Campaign data and the ATUS dataset (`data(cdc)`). Data collection involves a \"Time-Use Participatory Campaign\" where students monitor their own activities like sleeping, studying, eating, and media consumption. An image legend for activity icons is also referenced."

    "body": "Unit 1, Section 3, \"Would You Look at the Time!\", spans 9 instructional days and focuses on the fundamental utility of data. A key enduring understanding emphasized throughout Unit 1, Section 3 is that data serves as a powerful tool for evaluating various claims and reports. By effectively summarizing both categorical and numerical data, students can discern important features and patterns, which in turn provide robust evidence to substantiate claims. To initiate student engagement, Unit 1, Section 3 incorporates an exploration of the interactive graphic titled *How Men and Women Spend Their Days*. This graphic, created by Nathan Yau, draws its data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), a comprehensive dataset collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). This initial activity is designed to pique students' curiosity about how individuals, including themselves, allocate their time daily. The interactive graphic can be accessed at: [http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/07/31/business/20080801-metrics-graphic.html?_r=0](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/07/31/business/20080801-metrics-graphic.html?_r=0){:target=\"_blank\"}.

    "title": "Unit 1, Section 3: Statistical and Data Science Learning Objectives",
    "body": "Unit 1, Section 3, \"Would You Look at the Time!\", a 9-day instructional unit, introduces students to key statistical and data science concepts essential for data analysis. A primary statistical/mathematical learning objective (S-ID 5) requires students to summarize categorical data across two categories using two-way frequency tables. They will also learn to interpret various relative frequencies—joint, marginal, and conditional—within the context of the data, and to identify potential associations and trends revealed by the data. Another critical objective (S-IC 6) focuses on the ability to evaluate reports that are based on data. From a data science perspective, students in Unit 1, Section 3 will gain an understanding that data is collected and stored in specific formats. Crucially, they will learn that before any data analysis can commence, the data must undergo a cleaning process to ensure it is readable and suitable for processing. This preparation is a foundational step in Unit 1, Section 3's approach to practical data work. The enduring understanding that data summaries provide evidence for claims is central to these objectives, reinforcing the importance of rigorous data handling and interpretation."

Students will acquire proficiency in several practical tasks crucial for data manipulation and analysis. Specifically, they will learn to create tabular displays for categorical data and generate summaries of numerical data within RStudio. A core skill developed in Unit 1, Section 3 is the ability to create two-way frequency tables, along with their relative frequency counterparts. Furthermore, RStudio will be utilized to calculate various types of relative frequencies, including joint, marginal, and conditional relative frequencies. The unit also covers advanced data handling techniques such as subsetting data frames and creating new categorical variables derived from existing numerical variables. A vital component of the computational objectives in Unit 1, Section 3 is the process of cleaning and polishing data, ensuring it is in a readable and usable format for analysis. These practical skills align with the broader data science objective of understanding data formats and the necessity of data cleaning before analysis. The enduring understanding that data summaries provide evidence for claims is directly supported by the ability to computationally generate and interpret these summaries."
