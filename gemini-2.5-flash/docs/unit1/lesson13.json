    "title": "Understanding the RStudio/Posit Cloud Interface Panes",
    "body": "In Unit 1 Lesson 13, 'RStudio Basics,' students are introduced to the RStudio/Posit Cloud interface, which is organized into several key rectangular areas known as 'panes.' Understanding each pane's function is crucial for effective data analysis. The 'preview' pane, often referred to as a spreadsheet view, is where variables and observations (rows and columns of data) can be visually inspected. The 'console' pane serves as the primary input area where RStudio waits for commands, and it also displays the immediate results of executed code. The 'plot' pane is dedicated to generating and displaying plots, graphs, and other visualizations created from data. Lastly, the 'environment' pane allows users to view values and objects that have been loaded or created within the R session, providing an overview of the active workspace. These panes collectively form the interactive environment for learning R programming for data analysis."

    "title": "Initial Data Loading and Viewing with RStudio Commands",
    "body": "As part of Unit 1 Lesson 13, 'RStudio Basics,' students learn to initiate data analysis by accessing RStudio/Posit Cloud and loading datasets. After logging in via [https://portal.thinkdataed.org](https://portal.thinkdataed.org) using their school email, students are introduced to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) dataset. This dataset contains valuable information about teenagers on various topics. To load and view this data in their RStudio workspace, students will use two essential R commands in the 'console' pane: `data(cdc)` to load the dataset, and `View(cdc)` to open a spreadsheet-like view of the data in the 'preview' pane. Observing the 'environment' pane after these commands, students will see how the data is displayed in rows and columns, laying the groundwork for further exploration of variables and observations."

    "title": "Exploring Dataset Structure: Variables, Dimensions, and Help in RStudio",
    "body": "In Unit 1 Lesson 13, 'RStudio Basics,' students delve deeper into understanding dataset structure using specific R commands with the CDC dataset. To list all the variables within the dataset, the `names(cdc)` command is used in the 'console,' revealing variable names such as age, sex, grade, height, and weight. This output can then be compared to the information displayed in the 'preview' pane. For more detailed information about the dataset, including metadata and units of measurement (e.g., height reported in meters), students use the `help(cdc)` command. To ascertain the overall size of the dataset, the `dim(cdc)` command provides the number of rows (observations) and columns (variables). For the CDC dataset, this command reveals 17,232 rows and 32 columns, information that is also visible in the 'preview' and 'environment' panes, reinforcing the concept of observations and variables."

    "title": "Differentiating Variables: Categorical vs. Numerical with tally() Command",
    "body": "A key learning point in Unit 1 Lesson 13, 'RStudio Basics,' is distinguishing between different types of variables. Students learn to use the `tally()` command to analyze variables from the CDC dataset. For a categorical variable like 'seat_belt,' typing `tally(~seat_belt, data = cdc)` into the 'console' will display distinct categories (e.g., 'Never') along with the number of observations for each, demonstrating grouped data. In contrast, when applying `tally(~height, data = cdc)` to a numerical variable like 'height,' the output shows that levels are missing because numerical variables consist of a range of numbers rather than distinct categories. This practical demonstration helps students understand that 'seat_belt' is a categorical variable (consisting of groupings) and 'height' is a numerical variable (consisting of numbers), a fundamental concept in data science."

    "title": "Introduction to RStudio Labs and Code Execution",
    "body": "Unit 1 Lesson 13, 'RStudio Basics,' also prepares students for ongoing practical application through RStudio labs. Students are informed that they will be learning RStudio code to work with data and will complete several labs throughout the course. The `load_labs()` command, when typed into the 'console,' displays a menu of available labs, allowing students to select a specific lab, such as Unit 1 Lab 1A, by typing its corresponding number. Once a lab is selected, its presentation appears in the 'plot' pane. Students learn that grey boxes within the presentation contain lines of code that they must type into the 'console.' The output of this code, whether a plot or text, will then appear either in the 'plot' pane (e.g., a visualization) or the 'console' itself. Students are shown how to toggle between the 'plots' and 'presentation' tabs to view both the instructions and their generated results, setting the stage for completing Unit 1 Lab 1A on the subsequent day."

    "title": "Executing Lab Code and Navigating RStudio Output",
    "body": "As part of Unit 1 Lesson 13, 'RStudio Basics,' students are guided on how to interact with RStudio labs effectively. After loading the menu of labs using the `load_labs()` command and selecting a specific lab, such as Unit 1 Lab 1A, its presentation is displayed in the 'plot' pane. The lesson emphasizes that any time a grey box with a line of code appears in the presentation, students are expected to accurately type that code into the 'console' pane. The output generated from executing this code will then appear either directly in the 'console' (for textual results) or in the 'plot' pane (for visualizations like graphs). Students are explicitly taught how to toggle between the 'plots' and 'presentation' tabs at the bottom right-hand side of the interface to view the current slide of the lab's instructions and then examine the resulting plot or output. This hands-on process solidifies their understanding of RStudio's interactive nature and prepares them for independent lab work, with Unit 1 Lab 1A scheduled for completion the following day."
