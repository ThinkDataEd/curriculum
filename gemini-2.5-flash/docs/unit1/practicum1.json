    "title": "Achieving a 4-Point Response in Unit 1's Data Cycle Practicum",
    "body": "To earn a top score of 4 points in the 'Practicum: The Data Cycle & My Food Habits' within Unit 1, specific criteria must be met. The created poster must impeccably illustrate how the Data Cycle is effectively used to address the central research question, 'What do our snacking habits reveal about us?'. Furthermore, a statistical graphic—such as a histogram, bar chart, or scatterplot—must be correctly generated and included. The presentation of the statistical question's answer requires a robust justification. This justification must not only mention statistical concepts learned during Unit 1, explicitly citing elements like variable definitions, but also include a clear acknowledgment of variability, often by stating observed ranges or differences in the data. This comprehensive approach demonstrates a deep understanding of the practicum's objectives."

    "title": "Criteria for 3-Point and 2-Point Responses in The Data Cycle Practicum",
    "body": "For the 'Practicum: The Data Cycle & My Food Habits' in Unit 1, a 3-point response signifies strong performance, requiring the poster to correctly illustrate the Data Cycle's application to the research question. It also demands a correctly created statistical graphic and a presented answer with justification. However, unlike a 4-point response, the justification for a 3-point response needs to include *either* a mention of statistics concepts learned *or* an acknowledgment of variability, rather than both. A 2-point response indicates a partial understanding; the poster partially illustrates the Data Cycle, a statistical graphic (though not necessarily correct) is created, and an answer with justification is presented. These tiers help differentiate levels of mastery in applying Data Cycle principles from Unit 1."

    "title": "Identifying Lower Scores (1-Point and 0-Point) in Unit 1 Practicum Assessment",
    "body": "In the 'Practicum: The Data Cycle & My Food Habits' for Unit 1, lower scores indicate significant deficiencies. A 1-point response is given if the poster incorrectly illustrates how the Data Cycle addresses the research question, or if an answer to the statistical question is presented but lacks a justification, even if a statistical graphic was correctly created. The lowest score, a 0-point response, is assigned when the Data Cycle is entirely missing from the poster, or it fails to show how it addresses the research question. Additionally, a 0-point response results if any required graphical representation (histogram, dot plot, etc.) is incorrectly created or missing, or if there is no answer and/or no justification provided for the statistical question. These criteria highlight fundamental missing elements in the application of Unit 1 concepts."

Students are instructed to create a poster that clearly illustrates how this cycle is used to address the research topic, 'What do our snacking habits reveal about us?' This illustration is a key scoring parameter across all response levels. Furthermore, the practicum places a strong emphasis on statistical evidence, requiring students to generate at least one statistical graphic using RStudio, which must be incorporated into their poster. The subsequent presentation of findings necessitates the use of appropriate evidence from the collected data, reinforcing the importance of data-driven conclusions and analytical rigor learned throughout Unit 1."

    "title": "Understanding Variability and Statistical Concepts in Justifications for Unit 1 Practicum",
    "body": "A critical component of successful performance in the 'Practicum: The Data Cycle & My Food Habits' in Unit 1 lies in the justification of findings. For higher scores, especially a 4-point response, students must present an answer to their statistical question with a justification that robustly integrates statistical concepts learned throughout Unit 1. This includes explicit mention of variables or other relevant statistical terminology. Crucially, the justification must also acknowledge variability inherent in the data. Phrases like 'There are between __ and __' exemplify this, demonstrating an understanding that data often shows a range rather than a single fixed value. This dual requirement ensures a deep and nuanced interpretation of the data from the Unit 1 Campaign: Food Habits."
