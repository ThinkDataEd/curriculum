    "body": "Unit 1 Lab 1H, titled \"Our Time\" and located at `.\\docs\\unit1\\lab1h.md`, is designed as a culminating exercise where students integrate and apply a broad spectrum of previously acquired data analysis skills. The lab's core objective is to conduct a statistical investigation into the research question: \"How did our class spend our time?\" This involves a multi-step process beginning with the acquisition of raw \"Time Use\" campaign data, which is initially messy and difficult to interpret. Students will then utilize the custom `timeuse_format` function to clean and structure this data, transforming it so that each row represents a 'typical day' for an individual student by aggregating and averaging their reported daily activities. Following data preparation, the lab guides students through exploratory analysis of the formatted `timeuse` dataset, including identifying observations, variables, and their own personal data record. A key component is the formulation of specific statistical investigative questions derived from the main research question. The analysis culminates in comparing personal data against class trends, justifying findings with robust statistical graphics and summary tables, and explaining any data subsetting used. Instructions differentiate between questions to be answered on the computer (blue) and those requiring journal entries (red), ensuring a comprehensive engagement with both practical computation and conceptual understanding."

    "title": "Data Preparation in Unit 1 Lab 1H: Importing, Formatting, and Saving 'Time Use' Data",
    "body": "The initial and critical phase of Unit 1 Lab 1H, \"Our Time,\" involves meticulously preparing the raw data for statistical analysis. Students are instructed to perform the essential steps of exporting, uploading, and importing the specific data collected from their class’s \"Time Use\" campaign. It is explicitly noted that this raw data, in its original state, is inherently messy and would be exceptionally difficult to interpret or analyze effectively. To overcome this significant hurdle, the lab introduces a specialized function: `timeuse_format()`. Students are guided to apply this function using the syntax `timeuse <- timeuse_format( ______ )`, where the blank must be filled with the name of their imported raw data. The primary purpose of `timeuse_format()` is to clean and standardize the data, ensuring that the resulting `timeuse` dataset is well-structured. Each individual row in this formatted dataset will then concisely represent a 'typical day' for each student within the class, making it readily amenable to detailed statistical investigation. After successfully formatting the data, a crucial practical step is to save the cleaned `timeuse` dataset. A hint is provided to assist students in this process: they should consult their `History` tab to locate the necessary code for saving their formatted `timeuse` data as an `R` data file, typically with a `.Rda` extension. This ensures the processed data is persistently stored and can be easily retrieved for further analysis or future reference within Unit 1 Lab 1H, contributing to the overall research question of \"How did our class spend our time?\""

    "title": "Understanding the `timeuse_format` Function and `timeuse` Data Structure in Unit 1 Lab 1H",
    "body": "For students engaged in Unit 1 Lab 1H, \"Our Time,\" a deeper understanding of the `timeuse_format` function is essential for effective data analysis. This function is specifically engineered to convert complex, raw daily activity logs into a simplified, interpretable format, crucial for investigating \"How our class spent our time.\" At its core, `timeuse_format` operates by processing each student's raw daily data. It systematically adds up the total time spent on every distinct activity for each recorded day. Following this aggregation, it then calculates the average time dedicated to each activity across all the reported days for that particular student. The outcome of this meticulous process is the creation of a comprehensive representation of a 'typical day' in the life of each individual student in the class. Consequently, the `timeuse` dataset, generated by `timeuse <- timeuse_format( ______ )`, is structured such that every single row corresponds precisely to one student's calculated 'typical day.' Before proceeding with advanced analysis, students are instructed to thoroughly explore this newly structured `timeuse` data. This initial exploration includes determining the total number of observations (representing each student's typical day) and the number of variables (representing the various activities or characteristics measured). A particularly important task is for each student to identify which specific row within this dataset accurately represents *their own* 'typical day,' allowing for personalized insights and comparisons throughout the statistical investigation of Unit 1 Lab 1H."

    "title": "Exploring Formatted Data and Defining Investigative Questions in Unit 1 Lab 1H",
    "body": "In Unit 1 Lab 1H, \"Our Time,\" once the \"Time Use\" campaign data has been successfully imported and meticulously formatted using the `timeuse_format` function, students transition to the crucial stages of data exploration and question formulation. The first step in this phase is to thoroughly familiarize themselves with the cleaned `timeuse` dataset. This involves answering fundamental questions about its structure: specifically, identifying the total count of observations (which correspond to each student's typical day) and the number of variables (representing different activities or attributes within the dataset). Additionally, students must accurately list the names of all variables present in the `timeuse` data to understand its scope. A personalized aspect of this exploration requires each student to pinpoint the specific row within the `timeuse` dataset that unequivocally represents *their own* 'typical day,' enabling self-referential analysis. Building upon this foundational understanding, the lab then pivots to its central statistical investigation, driven by the overarching research question: \"How did our class spend our time?\" To systematically address this broad inquiry, students are tasked with formulating and answering two distinct statistical investigative questions. These questions, clearly based on the main research question, serve to guide the subsequent analytical steps, ensuring a focused and structured approach to uncovering patterns and insights within the class's collective time usage in Unit 1 Lab 1H. Remember, questions in <span style=\"color:midnightblue;\">**blue**</span> are for the computer, and those in <span style=\"color:firebrick;\">**red**</span> are for the journal."

    "title": "Conducting the Statistical Investigation: Analysis, Comparison, and Justification in Unit 1 Lab 1H",
    "body": "The core of Unit 1 Lab 1H, \"Our Time,\" revolves around a comprehensive statistical investigation designed to answer the research question: \"How did our class spend our time?\" Following the formulation of specific investigative questions and initial data exploration, students proceed with in-depth analysis of the `timeuse` dataset. A critical component of this phase involves drawing comparisons between an individual student's 'typical day' and the broader patterns observed across the entire class. Students are specifically asked to identify and articulate one aspect where their personal data is 'typical' in relation to the class, and conversely, one way in which their data 'differs' significantly. To ensure the robustness and credibility of their findings, students are unequivocally required to justify all their answers and conclusions. This justification must be supported by appropriate statistical graphics, such as various plots learned in previous labs, and well-constructed summary tables, which can include two-way frequency tables or other descriptive statistics. Furthermore, the lab anticipates that students may employ data subsetting techniques to refine their analysis, perhaps to focus on particular activities, demographics, or time periods. If data subsetting is utilized, students must provide a clear explanation of *why* they chose to subset their data and *how* this technique specifically benefited their analysis, leading to more focused or insightful conclusions. This holistic approach, from initial data processing using `timeuse_format` to rigorous justification, ensures a thorough and well-supported statistical inquiry within Unit 1 Lab 1H."

The critical first analytical step is the application of the `timeuse_format()` function, specifically `timeuse <- timeuse_format( ______ )`, which serves to clean and structure the data. This function meticulously processes each student's daily activities, summing up and then averaging the time spent on each, ultimately creating a `timeuse` dataset where each row uniquely represents a student's 'typical day.' After saving this formatted `timeuse` data as an `.Rda` file for persistence, students delve into exploratory analysis. This involves identifying the number of observations and variables, listing variable names, and, crucially, locating the row that details *their own* 'typical day.' The core of the investigation then emerges with the formulation of two precise statistical investigative questions derived from the main research question. Students proceed to perform a detailed analysis, which includes comparing their personal time usage patterns to those of the wider class, highlighting both typical aspects and unique differences. All analytical findings and comparisons must be rigorously justified using appropriate statistical graphics (e.g., plots for various variable types) and summary tables (e.g., two-way frequency tables). Furthermore, if data subsetting is employed to refine specific views, its methodology and benefits must be clearly articulated.
