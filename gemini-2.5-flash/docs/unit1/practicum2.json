    "title": "Key Tasks and Deliverables for the Teen Depression Practicum",
    "body": "The 'Teen Depression' practicum outlines several critical tasks that students must accomplish with their partners. The primary deliverable is the creation of a poster that directly addresses the research topic: 'What factors are associated with depression in teens?' As part of their analysis, students are required to generate at least one statistical question pertinent to the research topic. Furthermore, they must utilize RStudio to produce a minimum of one statistical graphic, which is a mandatory inclusion on their poster. Finally, students and their partners will present their findings, ensuring their conclusions are supported by appropriate evidence derived from the analyzed CDC data. This multi-faceted assignment combines data analysis, visualization, and presentation skills."

    "title": "Presentation, Awards, and Assessment Criteria for Teen Depression Practicum",
    "body": "Upon completion of their analytical work and poster creation, students in the 'Teen Depression' practicum are required to present their findings to their teams. These presentations must include appropriate evidence drawn from the data analysis, particularly highlighting the statistical graphic created using RStudio. To foster engagement and excellence, the teacher will recognize outstanding projects with specific awards: 'Best Statistical Question' and 'Most Interesting Statistical Graphic'. The practicum's success is evaluated using a detailed scoring guide, which assesses various aspects of the students' work, including the identification of possible factors associated with teen depression, the quality of graphical representations, and the statistical rigor of their justifications. The scoring guide provides a clear rubric from a 4-point to a 0-point response."
  },
  {
    "title": "High-Level Scoring Criteria: 4-Point Response in Teen Depression Practicum",
    "body": "For the 'Teen Depression' practicum, a 4-point response signifies the highest level of achievement and demonstrates a thorough understanding and application of statistical concepts. To earn this score, the student's poster must clearly identify possible factors within the CDC dataset that show an association with depression in teens. A crucial element is the creation of a graphical representation that effectively illustrates this association. Furthermore, the poster and presentation must provide a well-reasoned answer to the statistical question, accompanied by a robust justification. This justification specifically needs to incorporate statistics concepts learned throughout the curriculum, exemplified by statements like 'The variables are…'. Additionally, a top-tier response explicitly acknowledges variability, using phrases such as 'There are between ____ and ____,' indicating a comprehensive understanding of data nuances."
  },
  {
    "title": "Mid-Level Scoring Criteria: 3-Point and 2-Point Responses in Teen Depression Practicum",
    "body": "The scoring guide for the 'Teen Depression' practicum distinguishes between different levels of student performance. A 3-point response, while strong, shows slightly less depth than a 4-point response. For this score, the poster identifies possible factors in the CDC data associated with teen depression, and a graphical representation showing an association is created. An answer and justification for the statistical question are presented, but the justification either includes mention of statistics concepts learned thus far (e.g., 'The variables are…') OR includes acknowledgment of variability (e.g., 'There are between ____ and ____'), rather than both as required for a 4-point response. A 2-point response further simplifies the requirements: the poster identifies possible factors associated with depression in teens, a graphical representation showing an association is created, and an answer with a justification for the statistical question is presented, but with less emphasis on the specific statistical depth of the justification compared to higher scores."
  },
  {
    "title": "Lower-Level Scoring Criteria: 1-Point and 0-Point Responses in Teen Depression Practicum",
    "body": "The 'Teen Depression' practicum's scoring guide outlines criteria for lower-scoring responses, indicating areas where student work may fall short. A 1-point response is awarded when the poster identifies possible factors associated with depression in teens, and a histogram, bar chart, scatterplot, or other graphical representation was correctly created. However, for this score, an answer to the statistical question is presented, but a justification for that answer is notably missing, indicating a lack of analytical depth or explanation. A 0-point response signifies a fundamental failure to meet the practicum's core requirements. This score is given if the poster fails to identify any possible factors associated with depression in teens. Additionally, if a graphical representation (such as a histogram or dot plot) is incorrectly created or entirely missing, or if there is no answer and/or no justification for the answer to the statistical question, the response will receive 0 points."
