    "title": "Unit 1 Lesson 17: Interpreting Two-Way Tables - Overview",
    "body": "This lesson, Unit 1 Lesson 17, titled 'Interpreting Two-Way Tables,' is designed to enable students to calculate and explain conditional, marginal, and joint frequencies within the context of data. Key vocabulary introduced includes marginal, joint, and conditional relative frequencies, with essential concepts highlighting their distinct roles in understanding the distribution of single variables versus the distribution of variables when subsetted. The lesson begins with monitoring the 'Time Use Campaign' data collection, emphasizing it as the final day for data submissions and engaging students in strategies to improve collection. Core activities involve the in-depth analysis of two-way tables, starting with student-generated tables and progressing to a provided 'Cat Ownership and Instruments' example. Students learn to identify and calculate joint, marginal, and conditional relative frequencies using this example, applying their understanding to test 'Rosa’s theory' regarding cat ownership and musicianship. A hands-on card sorting activity forms a significant part of the lesson, utilizing LMR_U1_L17_A ('Analyzing Categorical Variables') and LMR_U1_L17_B ('Interpreting Categorical Variables'). In this activity, student teams match visualizations and numerical summaries to statistical questions and provide evidence-based answers. The lesson culminates in a team poster project, where students create their own two-way frequency table and formulate five distinct types of questions (marginal frequency, marginal relative frequency, joint frequency, joint relative frequency, and conditional relative frequency) based on their data. Homework involves generating questions from a new data table, and students are instructed to complete Unit 1 Lab 1G prior to Unit 1 Practicum 2."

    "title": "Unit 1 Lesson 17: Core Objectives and Key Terminology",
    "body": "Unit 1 Lesson 17, titled 'Interpreting Two-Way Tables,' establishes the objective for students to calculate and interpret various frequencies from two-way tables. The core objective is for students to calculate conditional, marginal, and joint frequencies and to articulate what these calculations mean in the specific context of the provided data. This lesson introduces crucial vocabulary essential for understanding and discussing categorical data analysis. Students will learn the definition of 'marginal (relative) frequency,' which refers to the total counts found in the margins of a two-way table, representing the distribution of a single variable. They will also grasp 'joint (relative) frequency,' defined as a fraction that indicates how many members of a group share two particular characteristics, typically found within the main body cells of the table. Lastly, 'conditional relative frequency' is introduced as the ratio of a joint relative frequency to a related marginal relative frequency, which is vital for understanding how one variable's distribution changes when 'subsetting' or conditioning on a specific category of another variable. These essential concepts highlight that marginal frequencies provide insight into the distribution of a single variable, while conditional relative frequencies describe the distribution of one variable when a specific subset of the other variable is considered, offering a deeper statistical understanding."

    "title": "Unit 1 Lesson 17: Resources and Campaign Data Review",
    "body": "For Unit 1 Lesson 17, 'Interpreting Two-Way Tables,' a set of specific materials is necessary to facilitate comprehensive student engagement and learning activities. These include basic classroom supplies such as poster paper and markers for collaborative projects. Two specialized Learning Materials Resources (LMRs) are central to the lesson: LMR_U1_L17_A, 'Analyzing Categorical Variables,' and LMR_U1_L17_B, 'Interpreting Categorical Variables.' Advance preparation is required for LMR_U1_L17_A, as it needs to be cut into individual sets comprising 20 cards each (12 visuals and 8 numerical summaries) for student team use. The lesson commences with a 'Time Use Campaign' data collection monitoring session, underscoring the final day for data submission for this campaign. Students are directed to the IDS Campaign Monitoring Tool at `https://portal.thinkdataed.org` to review data collection progress. They analyze key metrics such as the total data collected, the number of active and inactive users, and total responses. Through a Think-Pair-Share (TPS) activity, students are prompted to consider and discuss strategies to increase their data collection, emphasizing the importance of their ongoing contributions to the Unit 1 Campaign data."

    "title": "Unit 1 Lesson 17: Exploring Joint Frequencies in Two-Way Tables",
    "body": "Unit 1 Lesson 17, 'Interpreting Two-Way Tables,' reinforces prior knowledge by having student teams retrieve the two-way tables and associated questions they developed in the previous lesson. Before presenting their questions to the class, teams are instructed to strategize how they will efficiently collect and record data, as they are limited to asking only two questions with classmates responding by raising hands. A 'Whip Around' activity allows each team to ask their questions, with brief pauses for data recording. The lesson then transitions to a detailed example using a pre-provided 'Cat Ownership and Instruments' table, which categorizes students based on whether they own a cat and whether they play an instrument. Students are guided to answer questions such as: 'How many students own a cat and play an instrument?' (Answer: 7), 'What is the proportion of students who own a cat and play an instrument?' (7/35 = 0.2), and 'What is the proportion of students who do not own a cat and do not play an instrument?' (9/35 ≈ 0.257). Through team discussions and class volunteers, the lesson explicitly defines 'joint frequencies' as the initial counts found in the body cells of the table. When these counts are divided by the total number of observations, they are termed 'joint relative frequencies,' which indicate the proportion of individuals sharing two specific characteristics, a core concept in Unit 1 Lesson 17."

    "title": "Unit 1 Lesson 17: Unpacking Marginal Frequencies",
    "body": "Continuing the analysis of two-way tables in Unit 1 Lesson 17, 'Interpreting Two-Way Tables,' the focus shifts from joint frequencies to understanding marginal frequencies. Utilizing the 'Cat Ownership and Instruments' table, students are posed questions such as: 'How many students own a cat?' (Answer: 16), 'What is the proportion of students who own a cat?' (16/35 ≈ 0.46), and 'What is the proportion of students who do not play an instrument?' (18/35 ≈ 0.51). Students work in teams to discuss where on the table this information can be found and how to calculate it. Following team discussions, a volunteer team explains that 'marginal frequencies' are the initial total counts located in the margins of the table, representing the sum for a specific row or column. When these row or column totals are divided by the grand total number of observations, they become 'marginal relative frequencies.' These frequencies are crucial because, as highlighted in the essential concepts of Unit 1 Lesson 17, marginal (relative) frequencies provide insights into the distribution of a single variable. This means they tell us about one characteristic, such as 'owning a cat,' independently of the other characteristic, 'playing an instrument,' offering a fundamental understanding of individual variable distributions."

    "title": "Unit 1 Lesson 17: Introducing Conditional Relative Frequencies",
    "body": "Unit 1 Lesson 17, 'Interpreting Two-Way Tables,' progresses to introduce the concept of conditional relative frequencies, building upon the understanding of joint and marginal frequencies. Using the familiar 'Cat Ownership and Instruments' table, a pivotal question is presented: 'Of the students who play an instrument, what proportion own a cat?' This question necessitates focusing on a specific subset of the data. Through team discussions, students are guided to discern that to answer this, they must first identify the total number of students who play an instrument (17). Subsequently, they consider only this subset to determine how many among them also own a cat (7), leading to the calculation of the proportion as 7/17. This analytical process introduces the idea of 'conditioning'—being 'bound' by a specific variable (in this case, 'Plays an instrument'). The result of such a calculation is defined as a 'conditional relative frequency by column,' indicating that the denominator is the marginal total of the condition being applied. The essential concepts of Unit 1 Lesson 17 state that conditional relative frequencies reveal the distribution of one variable when 'subsetting' the other, providing a more detailed and contextual understanding of relationships within the dataset."

    "title": "Unit 1 Lesson 17: Advanced Conditional Frequencies and Practical Application",
    "body": "Further deepening the understanding of conditional relative frequencies in Unit 1 Lesson 17, 'Interpreting Two-Way Tables,' students engage with a comparative question to apply their knowledge: 'Do a greater proportion of students in Rosa’s art class who do not play an instrument own a cat than those who do play an instrument?' This question requires the calculation of an additional conditional relative frequency. Students are prompted to determine the proportion of students who own a cat specifically among those who *do not play an instrument* (9/18). By comparing this proportion (0.5) to the previously calculated proportion for those who *do play an instrument* (7/17 ≈ 0.41), they can draw a conclusion regarding Rosa's initial theory. The lesson explicitly states that the analysis reveals a higher proportion of students who do not play an instrument own a cat, thereby indicating that the data does not support Rosa's theory that musicians are more likely to own a cat. This step reinforces that a 'conditional relative frequency' is the ratio of a joint relative frequency to a related marginal relative frequency, enabling precise comparisons within specific subsets of data. Importantly, the lesson also notes that while these examples focused on 'conditional relative frequency by column,' similar calculations can be made 'by row' if the statistical question necessitates conditioning on a row variable instead."

    "title": "Unit 1 Lesson 17: Hands-On Analyzing Categorical Variables Activity",
    "body": "A key hands-on activity in Unit 1 Lesson 17, 'Interpreting Two-Way Tables,' involves the strategic use of two specific Learning Materials Resources (LMRs): LMR_U1_L17_A, 'Analyzing Categorical Variables,' and LMR_U1_L17_B, 'Interpreting Categorical Variables.' Student teams are provided with a complete set of cards from LMR_U1_L17_A, which requires prior preparation to cut the handout into 20 individual cards, consisting of 12 visual representations and 8 numerical summaries. Each team receives one full set of these cards, along with LMR_U1_L17_B, which functions as a guided worksheet. The primary task for each student team is to collaboratively determine which visualization(s) and numerical summaries from the card set (LMR_U1_L17_A) are most appropriate for answering specific statistical questions presented on LMR_U1_L17_B. Following this matching process, teams must then answer each statistical question, explicitly citing a numerical summary as concrete evidence for their response. Students are given the flexibility to either tape or glue the matched visuals and numerical summaries onto LMR_U1_L17_B, or simply record the plot letter and table number in the designated boxes. An additional blank column on the worksheet encourages teams to formulate their own unique statistical question that can be answered using any remaining unused visual and numerical summary from their card set."

    "title": "Unit 1 Lesson 17: Discussion and Justification in Categorical Data Analysis",
    "body": "Following the hands-on 'Analyzing Categorical Variables' activity in Unit 1 Lesson 17, 'Interpreting Two-Way Tables,' a critical class discussion is facilitated to review student answers and solidify their understanding. After student teams have been allotted ample time to complete LMR_U1_L17_B, the entire class convenes to go over the solutions collectively. A paramount pedagogical aspect emphasized during this discussion is the requirement for students to justify their answers by making direct reference to the visuals and numerical summaries (from LMR_U1_L17_A) they selected. This step ensures that students are not merely finding correct answers but are also articulating their reasoning and understanding *why* specific representations or calculations are appropriate for a given statistical question. For instance, the statistical question 'How many students neither own a cat or play an instrument?' can be correctly answered using multiple visuals (e.g., Plot E, Plot G, Plot I, Plot K) and numerical summaries (e.g., Tables 1 and 7). This multi-faceted approach highlights that different data displays can convey the same information effectively, thereby strengthening students' ability to interpret various forms of categorical data representation. The activity and the subsequent, justification-focused discussion serve to deeply ingrain students' comprehension of joint, marginal, and conditional frequencies by linking these abstract concepts to tangible data visualizations and summaries."

    "title": "Unit 1 Lesson 17: Synthesizing Frequency Concepts and Homework Assignment",
    "body": "As a culminating activity in Unit 1 Lesson 17, 'Interpreting Two-Way Tables,' student teams are directed to revisit the two-way frequency tables they created earlier in the lesson sequence. Each team is tasked with developing one poster that visually presents their two-way frequency table. Crucially, they are challenged to formulate five distinct statistical questions about the data contained within their table. These questions must specifically be answerable by: a marginal frequency, a marginal relative frequency, a joint frequency, a joint relative frequency, and a conditional relative frequency (which can be either by row or by column). This comprehensive exercise ensures a thorough application of all the frequency types and essential concepts covered throughout the Unit 1 Lesson 17. If time permits, teams are encouraged to pair up and present their findings and questions to another peer team, fostering collaborative learning and peer discussion. For homework, students are provided with a new data table titled 'Work Preference and the Color Red' and are instructed to generate two new questions from it: one that requires a marginal relative frequency to answer, and another that requires a conditional relative frequency. The lesson concludes by instructing students to complete Unit 1 Lab 1G, 'What’s the FREQ?,' prior to advancing to Unit 1 Practicum 2, reinforcing the practical application of frequency calculations."
