    "title": "Abstract: Unit 1 Campaign 2 - Time Use Analysis",
    "body": "This document outlines \"Unit 1 Campaign 2: Time Use,\" a campaign designed to help students analyze and compare their daily time allocation with that of the U.S. population. The campaign addresses concerns about increasing technology interaction by prompting students to reflect on their personal time usage through a series of guiding questions. Participants will collect data on various activities, categorized similarly to the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), for a period of 5-10 days, emphasizing accurate reporting without 'double-dipping' time. The objectives include using statistical tools like single and multivariable plots (histograms, bar graphs, scatterplots), summary statistics (mean, median, MAD, standard deviation), and frequency tables to identify similarities and differences in time use patterns between students and the broader U.S. population. Key instructions cover data collection methods, variable definitions, and the importance of accurate reporting. The campaign culminates in a practicum where students answer a statistical question based on their collected data, utilizing technical analysis methods in RStudio and interactive graphics."

    "title": "Introduction to Unit 1 Campaign 2: Analyzing Personal Time Use",
    "body": "This document introduces \"Unit 1 Campaign 2: Time Use,\" a comprehensive initiative designed to investigate how individuals allocate their daily time. The campaign stems from a prevalent societal concern regarding the increasing amount of time people spend interacting with technology and the Internet. This issue prompts fundamental questions about personal time management, such as how one's time is spent, whether distinct groups exhibit different time-use patterns, and how individual time allocation compares to that of the broader American population. The core objective is for students to engage in self-reflection and comparative analysis, using empirical data to understand their habits. This campaign serves as a practical application of statistical analysis, encouraging students to critically examine their daily routines and contextualize them within national trends, particularly by comparing their data to the American Time Use Survey (ATUS). The ultimate goal is to foster a deeper understanding of personal and societal time use through structured data collection and analytical methods."

    "title": "Survey Design and Key Variables for Unit 1 Campaign 2: Time Use Data Collection",
    "body": "\"Unit 1 Campaign 2: Time Use\" involves students collecting personal time allocation data using a structured survey. The survey questions are meticulously designed with categories mirroring those found in the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), ensuring that student data can be meaningfully compared to nationally representative estimates of how Americans spend their time. Before data collection commences, it is imperative to establish a class-wide consensus on the precise meaning and classification of various activities to ensure data accuracy and consistent interpretation. A critical rule for data entry is 'no double dipping' of time; for instance, minutes spent reading during a class period must be logged under 'school' rather than 'read'. Key variables include `day` (ordinal category, integers 1-10) and numerous activity-based `number` variables measured in minutes, such as `sleep`, `meals`, `school`, `homework`, `work`, `grooming`, `travel`, `chores`, `television`, `videogames`, `sports`, `read`, `communicate`, `socialize`, `spiritual`, `purchases`, `extra`, and `social_media`. Additionally, `location`, `time`, and `date` are automatically recorded variables, enriching the dataset."

    "title": "Data Collection Guidelines and Duration for Unit 1 Campaign 2: Time Use",
    "body": "For \"Unit 1 Campaign 2: Time Use,\" students are required to diligently log their daily activities to collect accurate time-use data, enabling comparisons with the American Time Use Survey (ATUS). The recommended approach is to maintain a detailed log throughout the day, ensuring that all 1,440 minutes of a day are accounted for. To facilitate this comprehensive logging, students may find it beneficial to divide their day into three intervals: before school, after school, and in the evening, pausing at each interval to record their activities. Once a daily log is complete and comprehensive, students should submit a single survey corresponding to that specific day. The campaign's duration is flexible, requiring a minimum of five days of data collection, with a maximum allowance of ten days. To capture a more holistic view of time usage, it is highly recommended that at least two of these data collection days include a weekend, as daily routines often differ significantly between weekdays and weekends. Adherence to these guidelines is crucial for generating reliable data for subsequent statistical analysis, which is fundamental to achieving the campaign's objectives."

    "title": "Motivation and Initial Data Review in Unit 1 Campaign 2: Time Use",
    "body": "To initiate \"Unit 1 Campaign 2: Time Use\" and provide a contextual framework, students are encouraged to explore the New York Times Interactive Time Use graphic. This resource offers valuable insights into how Americans typically allocate their time, serving as a powerful motivational tool and a starting point for their personal comparative analysis with the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) data. Following the completion of the first day's data collection, it is essential to monitor student submissions to ensure every student has successfully entered their survey for Day 1. This initial check allows for prompt identification of any technical issues or misunderstandings in the data collection process. Furthermore, a critical discussion should ensue regarding common challenges encountered during data collection. Exploring questions such as \"What makes data collection hard?\" and \"Does this affect the quality of data?\" helps students understand the practical difficulties of research and the importance of accurate data for reliable statistical analysis and fulfilling campaign objectives."
