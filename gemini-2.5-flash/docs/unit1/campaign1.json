    "title": "Abstract: Unit 1 Campaign 1 - Food Habits Analysis",
    "body": "Unit 1 Campaign 1, titled 'Food Habits', guides students through a nine-day data collection and analysis process focused on personal snacking patterns. The campaign's core issue addresses the impact of nutritional information, inspired by the 1990 Nutrition Labeling Education Act. Students will explore their snacking habits, assess the healthiness of their choices, and compare their data to their classmates and national trends. Key objectives include developing an enduring understanding of how graph interpretation provides real-world insights, particularly by analyzing relationships between independent (x) and dependent (y) variables. The campaign involves collecting detailed snack data through surveys, monitoring data collection progress, and using tools like the Dashboard, Plot App, and RStudio for technical analysis. Students will answer guiding questions about snack healthiness, timing, and characteristics, culminating in a practicum report that addresses a statistical question based on the collected food habits data."

    "title": "Introduction to Unit 1 Campaign 1: Food Habits and Nutritional Awareness",
    "body": "Unit 1 Campaign 1, 'Food Habits', delves into consumer food choices and the impact of nutritional information. The campaign highlights the historical significance of the Nutrition Facts label, which became mandatory in 1990 under the Nutrition Labeling Education Act. This act aimed to empower consumers to make informed decisions about their diet. The campaign challenges students to reflect on whether knowing nutritional details influences their snacking habits, to understand their own snacking patterns, and to compare the healthiness of their food choices with their peers and broader national data. This foundational understanding sets the stage for data collection and analysis."

    "title": "Core Objectives of Unit 1 Campaign 1: Graph Interpretation and Variable Relationships",
    "body": "The primary objectives of Unit 1 Campaign 1, 'Food Habits', are designed to foster a deep understanding of data analysis. Upon completion, students are expected to grasp that interpreting graphs is a powerful tool for extracting useful information about real-world scenarios, as observed through collected data. A crucial learning outcome is the ability to explore and identify relationships between two variables. Students will learn that if a relationship exists, changes in the independent variable (x) are often the driving force behind changes observed in the dependent variable (y). This objective underpins all subsequent data analysis activities within the campaign."

    "title": "Campaign Rationale: Exploring Snacking Habits and Nutritional Choices",
    "body": "Unit 1 Campaign 1, 'Food Habits', is motivated by fundamental questions surrounding personal nutrition and consumer behavior. Students are prompted to consider if access to nutritional information truly alters their eating habits. They will investigate their individual snacking patterns, evaluate the healthiness of their typical snacks, and contextualize their findings by comparing them to their class and even national dietary trends. These questions serve as the impetus for the entire data collection and analysis process, aiming to provide students with tangible insights into their own food consumption and its broader implications."

    "title": "Defining Survey Variables for Consistent Data in Unit 1 Campaign 1",
    "body": "To ensure accurate and comparable data for Unit 1 Campaign 1, 'Food Habits', a crucial first step involves establishing a class-wide consensus on the meaning of survey variables. This collective agreement is vital for proper data analysis and interpretation. For example, the variable 'when' requires standardized definitions for time intervals such as 'morning,' 'afternoon,' 'evening,' and 'night.' Similarly, for the 'cost' variable, students must decide whether to record the total cost of a food item or calculate the unit cost per serving. These collective decisions are fundamental to the integrity and utility of the collected data."

    "title": "Detailed Survey Questions and Categorical Variables in Unit 1 Campaign 1",
    "body": "Unit 1 Campaign 1, 'Food Habits', utilizes a comprehensive survey to collect data on snacking habits. Key categorical variables include 'when,' with options for 'morning,' 'afternoon,' 'evening,' and 'night,' defined by class consensus. The 'salty_sweet' variable categorizes snacks as 'Salty' or 'Sweet.' The 'why' variable captures reasons for snacking, such as 'availability,' 'craving,' 'emotional,' 'energy,' 'hungry/thirsty,' 'social,' or 'other.' Additionally, the 'cost' variable is categorical, spanning ranges from '$0 to < $1' to '$7 or more.' These structured categories enable consistent data collection for analysis within the campaign."

  {
    "title": "Numerical and Automatic Variables for Snack Data in Unit 1 Campaign 1",
    "body": "The survey for Unit 1 Campaign 1, 'Food Habits', includes several numerical variables to quantify snack characteristics. These include 'healthy_level' (a scale from 1=Very unhealthy to 5=Very healthy), 'calories' per serving, 'protein' grams per serving, 'sugar' grams per serving, 'sodium' milligrams per serving, and 'ingredients' count. Beyond self-reported data, the survey automatically captures 'location' (latitude, longitude), 'time,' 'date,' and 'user' ID, adding crucial context to each snack entry. An optional 'snack_image' can also be submitted, enriching the data collected for the campaign."
  },
  {
    "title": "Guidelines for Data Collection Frequency and Campaign Duration in Unit 1 Campaign 1",
    "body": "For Unit 1 Campaign 1, 'Food Habits', students are advised to take the snack survey either every time they consume a snack or at the end of each day, with reminders available to ensure consistent completion. The campaign is designed to last approximately nine days, intentionally incorporating two weekend days to capture a broader range of snacking behaviors. This specific duration and frequency are crucial for gathering sufficient and diverse data, enabling students to accurately analyze their food habits and observe patterns over a meaningful period as part of the campaign's objectives."

  {
    "title": "Monitoring Data Collection Progress in Unit 1 Campaign 1",
    "body": "A critical component of Unit 1 Campaign 1, 'Food Habits', is the active monitoring of data collection. As a class, students must agree on a target number of surveys each individual should submit, with a minimum of four surveys per student and an emphasis on roughly equal contributions. The 'Campaign Monitoring' tool is used to track individual data collection after the first day. After two to three days, attention is drawn to the 'Total Responses by Day' plot to analyze data collection patterns, such as identifying days with high or low survey submissions. This monitoring fosters collective responsibility and insights into data gathering processes."

  {
    "title": "Interpreting Data Collection Patterns in Unit 1 Campaign 1",
    "body": "During Unit 1 Campaign 1, 'Food Habits', students will analyze the 'Total Responses by Day' plot using the Campaign Monitoring tool to understand data collection trends. For instance, a common pattern might show high data collection during weekdays, with a noticeable drop over weekends, followed by a peak on the first day back (e.g., Monday). Discussions will center on the 'story' these patterns tell about student engagement and data input, prompting questions like: 'What makes data collection difficult?' and 'Does this affect the quality of our data?' This reflective analysis is key to understanding real-world data collection challenges."
