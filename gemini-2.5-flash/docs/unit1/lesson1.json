    "title": "Materials and Initial Engagement: The Target Story in Unit 1 Lesson 1",
    "body": "For Unit 1 Lesson 1, 'Data Trails,' several materials are essential to facilitate student learning and engagement. These include two crucial videos: 'The Target Story' (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvSA-6BJkx4) and 'Terms and Conditions' (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcjtEKNP05c), both integral to illustrating key concepts. Students will also require a Data Science (DS) journal, preferably a quad-ruled composition book, which must be available for every lesson. A specific handout, the 'Data Diary' (LMR_U1_L1, available at ../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_6.0/LMR_U1_L1.pdf), will be distributed for a hands-on activity. The lesson commences with showing 'The Target Story' video to introduce the topic. Following the video, students engage in a pair discussion using the TPS (Think-Pair-Share) strategy, responding to the question: 'How do you think Target knew about the daughter’s pregnancy before her father did?' This discussion sets the stage for understanding how organizations leverage collected data and patterns, revealing insights about individuals based on their purchasing habits, such as those associated with the daughter’s Red Card purchases, thereby linking to the broader objective of understanding data collection and its effects."

    "title": "Defining Data and Unveiling Personal Data Trails in Unit 1 Lesson 1",
    "body": "Following the discussion on 'The Target Story' in Unit 1 Lesson 1, 'Data Trails,' the class transitions to a whole-group discussion to solidify the foundational understanding of 'data.' Students explore key questions: 'What are data?' with the answer clarifying that data are information, or observations, that have been gathered and recorded. They then delve into 'Where do data come from?' identifying sources such as cell phones, computers, school records, and surveys. Practical examples are sought, differentiating between what constitutes data (e.g., age, height, eye color) and what does not (e.g., an unrecorded event). This segment leads directly to introducing the critical concept of 'data trails.' These are defined as the data collected about us as individuals, which can be analyzed to reveal patterns in our personal lives. The objective is to make students realize the extent of their own data trails, often unknowingly generated, and the information continuously being collected about them. This concept is further explored through the 'Data Diary' activity, where students will log their personal data interactions over a 24-hour period, reinforcing the lesson's objective to understand data collection and its pervasive nature."

    "title": "Homework: Data Diary Completion and Assessment Criteria for Unit 1 Lesson 1",
    "body": "The homework for Unit 1 Lesson 1, 'Data Trails,' requires students to complete the 'Data Diary' handout (LMR_U1_L1), which they began during class. This assignment is crucial for reinforcing their understanding of 'data trails'—the data collected about individuals that can reveal patterns in their personal lives. When grading the homework, the focus is on two key aspects. First, instructors will assess whether the data described by students could genuinely be collected, specifically through sensors or electronic surveillance, rather than mere human observation. For instance, 'a camera recorded me entering the store' is valid data, whereas 'someone saw me going into the store' is not. Second, the grading criteria also evaluate the reasonableness of students' ideas about how this collected data might be used, encouraging them to think critically about data's practical applications beyond simplistic 'spy' scenarios. This exercise aims to refine their understanding of how data are collected and the realistic implications of sharing that data, directly linking back to the lesson's objective of comprehending data collection and its effects. Additionally, a 'Class Scribes' activity, where one team summarizes the day's three most important topics, further aids in consolidating learning and encouraging deeper reflection on data, observations, and privacy."

    "body": "Unit 1 Lesson 1, 'Data Trails,' establishes a fundamental understanding of what constitutes 'data' and its omnipresence in our lives. Data are explicitly defined as information, or 'observations,' that have been gathered and recorded. These observations, which are essentially recorded data points, can originate from diverse sources, being collected by both human agents and an ever-increasing array of sensors. The lesson highlights a critical insight: patterns embedded within this collected data possess the capacity to unveil previously unknown or unapparent patterns in our world and in individuals' lives. This concept was vividly illustrated through 'The Target Story' video, demonstrating how purchasing data could predict personal life events. This reinforces the lesson's objective to understand what data are and how they are collected. The lesson further emphasizes that data play a substantial, though often unseen, role in our daily routines. The cumulative effect of this constant collection forms 'data trails,' which are personal records enabling the observation of individual life patterns, thereby making the invisible role of data tangible through activities like the 'Data Diary' assignment."
