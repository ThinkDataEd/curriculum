    "title": "Abstract: Practicum - What Does Our Campaign Data Say?",
    "body": "This practicum, titled 'What Does Our Campaign Data Say?', is part of Unit 3 and focuses on the analysis of data collected during a class-created Participatory Sensing campaign. The core objective for students is to answer specific statistical investigative questions, which were initially generated during Unit 3 Lesson 16, using RStudio. Students will generate both graphical representations and numerical summaries of their campaign data. The process involves selecting a research question, identifying relevant variables, and conducting thorough data analysis, which includes presenting plots, describing their findings, explaining their analytical choices, and demonstrating how the analysis directly addresses their chosen questions. Furthermore, students are required to include the RStudio code used for their plots. A critical thinking component involves determining if additional data would enhance the answers to their questions and proposing what that data might be. The practicum also encourages reflection on whether new questions arose during analysis or if data cleaning was necessary. The final output is a one-page report and a presentation to a classmate not on their team, based on the analysis of the class's campaign data."

    "title": "Context and Data Source for the Practicum",
    "body": "This practicum, 'What Does Our Campaign Data Say?', is situated within Unit 3 of the curriculum, building directly upon prior learning experiences. It specifically references the Participatory Sensing campaign creation lesson, Unit 3 Lesson 16, where the class collectively developed a research question regarding a topic of interest. The central focus of this practicum is the analysis and interpretation of the data collected from that *specific class-created campaign only*. Students are expected to work exclusively with their own campaign data. A key aspect of the practicum involves reflecting on the analysis to consider what additional data, if any, might be necessary to provide a more comprehensive answer to their statistical investigative questions. This ensures students not only analyze existing data but also critically evaluate its sufficiency."

    "title": "Essential Materials for 'Our Own Campaign' Practicum",
    "body": "To successfully complete the 'Practicum: What Does Our Campaign Data Say?' in Unit 3, students will require specific materials to guide their work. The primary resource listed is 'Our Own Campaign,' which is found within the Learning Management Resources (LMRs) document designated as [LMR_U3_Practicum_Our_Own_Campaign](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 3_v_6.0/LMR_U3_Practicum_Our_Own_Campaign.pdf). This document serves as a central guide for the practicum, providing instructions and context for the data analysis tasks. The practicum reinforces the use of class-created campaign data, stemming from research questions developed in Unit 3 Lesson 16. Students will use the guidelines from 'Our Own Campaign' to perform their analysis in RStudio, creating graphical representations and numerical summaries."

    "title": "Initial Steps: Selecting and Defining a Statistical Investigative Question",
    "body": "The first phase of the 'Practicum: What Does Our Campaign Data Say?' involves a foundational step in statistical inquiry: question selection. Students are instructed to refer back to the statistical investigative questions that their class generated during Unit 3 Lesson 16 through Unit 3 Lesson 18. These questions were developed to address the broader research question established at the outset of the Participatory Sensing campaign creation. From this pool of generated questions, students must choose one statistical investigative question to focus on. Following this selection, they need to critically determine which specific variables from their class-created campaign data are relevant and necessary to answer their chosen question. This step is crucial for defining the scope of their initial data analysis using RStudio."
  },
  {
    "title": "Detailed Data Analysis Requirements for the Chosen Question",
    "body": "For the statistical investigative question chosen in the 'Practicum: What Does Our Campaign Data Say?', students are required to conduct a thorough data analysis using RStudio, encompassing both graphical and numerical summaries. The analysis steps are highly detailed: first, students must provide the plot and numerical summary they create. Second, they need to describe precisely what the generated plot illustrates. Third, a critical explanation is required for *why* that particular type of plot was chosen over others. Fourth, students must clearly explain how both the plot and the numerical summary collectively provide an answer to their statistical investigative question. Finally, all RStudio code used to generate the plot must be included, ensuring transparency and reproducibility of their analysis. This comprehensive approach ensures a robust and well-justified data interpretation based on the class's campaign data collected from Unit 3 Lesson 16."

    "title": "Evaluating Data Sufficiency and Proposing Additional Data Needs",
    "body": "An important component of the 'Practicum: What Does Our Campaign Data Say?' involves critical reflection on the sufficiency of the collected data. After students have completed their initial analysis to answer their chosen statistical investigative question, they must determine if additional data would enhance or better answer that question. This analytical introspection requires students to consider various facets of data collection. They should propose what that additional data would entail, which could include exploring different variables, suggesting an alternative data collection approach, advocating for more people to be included in the study, or extending the data collection over a longer period. This step, occurring after analyzing data from the Unit 3 campaign, encourages students to think beyond existing datasets and consider the iterative nature of research and data acquisition."

    "title": "Expanding Analysis: Addressing Two More Statistical Investigative Questions",
    "body": "Beyond the initial deep dive into a single statistical investigative question, the 'Practicum: What Does Our Campaign Data Say?' extends the analysis to broaden students' understanding of their class-created campaign data. Students are instructed to choose two *additional* statistical investigative questions from the pool generated during Unit 3 Lesson 16 through Unit 3 Lesson 18. For these two new questions, they are expected to conduct a full analysis and interpretation of the data, similar to the process for the first question. This involves generating appropriate graphical representations and numerical summaries using RStudio, describing the findings, explaining methodological choices, and articulating how the analysis answers each question. This expansion ensures a more comprehensive exploration of the campaign data and the overarching research question developed earlier in the Participatory Sensing campaign."

    "title": "Reflecting on the Data Analysis Process: New Questions and Data Cleaning",
    "body": "The 'Practicum: What Does Our Campaign Data Say?' emphasizes the iterative and sometimes unpredictable nature of data analysis. Students are prompted to reflect on their analytical journey, specifically considering if, during the process of analyzing their class's campaign data (collected since Unit 3 Lesson 16), they thought of any *new* statistical investigative questions. This encourages emergent inquiry. Furthermore, students must consider whether they realized that their data needed to be cleaned or pre-processed before they could effectively answer their questions. This reflective step requires students to explain whether these situations arose with *any* of their chosen statistical investigative questions. This promotes an understanding that data analysis is not always a linear process and often involves adapting to insights gained or challenges encountered with the raw data."

  {
    "title": "Final Deliverables: One-Page Report and Presentation",
    "body": "The culmination of the 'Practicum: What Does Our Campaign Data Say?' is the creation of a comprehensive report and a presentation, allowing students to communicate their findings from the analysis of their class's Participatory Sensing campaign data. Students are required to write a one-page report summarizing their chosen statistical investigative questions, the analysis performed using RStudio (including plots and numerical summaries), and the conclusions drawn. Following the report, students must present their findings to another member of the class. It is specified that this presentation should be delivered to a classmate who is *not* a member of their own team, fostering peer-to-peer learning and external review of their analysis. This final step, based on data from Unit 3 Lessons 16-18, ensures students can articulate their analytical process and insights effectively."
