    "title": "Abstract: Implementing a Participatory Sensing Campaign (Unit 3 Lesson 19)",
    "body": "This lesson, Unit 3 Lesson 19, guides students through the practical implementation of their own Participatory Sensing Campaign. The objective is for students to mock-implement, create, and launch a survey on a topic of interest, subsequently initiating data collection. Key activities include teams evaluating their campaign questions for relevance using criteria from Unit 3 Lesson 18, utilizing the online Campaign Authoring Tool (available at `https://portal.thinkdataed.org`) to digitally construct their surveys, defining campaign metadata, survey structure, and individual prompts. Students will use the 'Campaign Creation' handout (LMR_U3_L17_B) from Unit 3 Lesson 17. The lesson culminates in the submission of the created campaign, making it live for users, and assigning students a five-day data collection period as homework. An essential concept emphasized is the optimization of Participatory Sensing Campaigns through prior data collection practice and rigorous evaluation before full deployment."

    "title": "Lesson Objectives and Initial Campaign Development in Unit 3 Lesson 19",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 19 aims for students to mock-implement, create, survey, and begin data collection for their own Participatory Sensing Campaign on a chosen topic. To achieve this, students utilize the 'Campaign Creation' handout (LMR_U3_L17_B), which was introduced in Unit 3 Lesson 17, and will later engage with the 'Campaign Authoring Tool' found at `https://portal.thinkdataed.org`. The lesson begins by reviewing class-generated campaign information, followed by team-based mock-implementation of their created campaigns. This mock-implementation involves asking each other survey questions to ensure clarity and relevance to their research and statistical questions. Students are encouraged to use evaluative questions from Unit 3 Lesson 18, step 10, to refine their campaigns. If improvements are suggested, teams propose them to the class, making final changes to optimize the campaign. This preparatory phase is crucial, as the essential concept for this lesson emphasizes that practicing data collection prior to implementation allows for the optimization of a Participatory Sensing Campaign."

    "title": "Utilizing the Campaign Authoring Tool for Campaign Setup in Unit 3 Lesson 19",
    "body": "As part of Unit 3 Lesson 19's objective to implement a Participatory Sensing Campaign, students are introduced to the 'Campaign Authoring Tool' accessible at `https://portal.thinkdataed.org`. The instructor demonstrates logging into the IDS Home Page and navigating to the 'Campaigns tab'. A video tutorial is also available at `https://youtu.be/PzwMCHOghnI` for additional assistance. The first stage of campaign creation within the tool is 'Campaign Info'. Here, users must provide a 'Campaign Name', ideally related to the topic of interest, and select their class/period. A concise, one-sentence 'Description' of the campaign is required, and the 'Campaign Status' should be set to 'Running'. To facilitate monitoring for improper responses, 'Data Sharing' must be selected as 'Disabled', and 'Editable Responses' should also be 'Disabled'. After completing these initial settings, the next step is to click the '+Add Survey' button to proceed with defining the survey structure. This detailed setup ensures the campaign is properly configured before moving on to question design."

    "title": "Designing Surveys and Prompts with the Campaign Authoring Tool in Unit 3 Lesson 19",
    "body": "Continuing the process of creating a Participatory Sensing Campaign in Unit 3 Lesson 19, students use the 'Campaign Authoring Tool' (`https://portal.thinkdataed.org`) to design their surveys and individual prompts. After setting up the 'Campaign Info', the next section is the 'Survey Window'. Here, users provide a 'Title' for the survey, which will be visible to participants. An internal 'ID' for the survey is also required, though it is not displayed to users. An optional 'Description' can be provided for display, which may be similar to the campaign's overall description. A 'Submission Message' is crucial, offering a brief message displayed after survey submission, and it's helpful to include a reminder for participants to click the green button to submit. Following the survey details, the user clicks the '+Add Prompt' button to define each question. For each prompt, a 'Prompt ID' (a short variable name) and a 'Prompt Label' (the displayed variable name) are needed. The actual 'Question Text' for data collection is then entered. Depending on the 'prompt type', additional information may be requested; for instance, a 'Text' prompt might require minimum and maximum character values. The 'Skippable' checkbox allows prompts to be optionally skipped, which is particularly recommended for photo prompts as some users might submit via a browser without photo capabilities. This iterative process of adding prompts is repeated for all survey questions, structuring the data collection effectively for their Participatory Sensing campaign."

    "title": "Finalizing and Deploying Campaigns in Unit 3 Lesson 19 using the Authoring Tool",
    "body": "In Unit 3 Lesson 19, after meticulously designing all survey questions and prompts within the 'Campaign Authoring Tool' (`https://portal.thinkdataed.org`), students move to the final stages of campaign creation and deployment. As the campaign is built, the underlying XML code that creates it is displayed. Students have the option to select the 'Highlight XML' checkbox, which helps them track where the information they are adding is embedded in the code. This feature also serves as an introduction to XML syntax, which students will explore in more detail later in Unit 3. Once all prompts have been added and reviewed, the campaign is made live by clicking the '|Submit Campaign|' button located on the top, right-hand side of the page. This action sends the completed campaign to the server, enabling users to begin submitting survey responses. After submission, students are instructed to use their smart devices or log back into the IDS Home Page to view their newly created Participatory Sensing Campaign. It's important to 'Refresh Campaigns' to ensure the latest version is displayed. Students should then navigate through the entire survey to verify that their questions are displayed correctly, though they do not need to upload a survey response at this stage. This final review ensures the campaign is ready for the upcoming data collection phase."

    "title": "Comprehensive Campaign Implementation and Data Collection Launch in Unit 3 Lesson 19",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 19 provides a comprehensive framework for students to implement their own Participatory Sensing campaign and initiate real-world data collection. The process begins with students collaborating in teams to mock-implement the campaigns they have designed, critically evaluating survey questions to ensure they yield relevant data for their research and statistical questions. This crucial evaluation phase leverages the evaluative questions found in Unit 3 Lesson 18, step 10. The practical creation of the campaign takes place using the 'Campaign Authoring Tool' (`https://portal.thinkdataed.org`), an online platform accessible through the IDS Home Page. Here, students configure 'Campaign Info' (name, description, status, data sharing, editable responses), structure the 'Survey Window' (title, ID, submission message), and define individual 'Prompt Information' (ID, label, question text, type-specific details, skippable options). The entire creation process, supported by the 'Campaign Creation' handout (LMR_U3_L17_B), reinforces the essential concept that careful design and pre-implementation practice optimize a Participatory Sensing Campaign. Once created, the campaign is submitted, making it available for public participation. The lesson culminates in a homework assignment where students are tasked with collecting data for the next five days using their newly implemented Participatory Sensing campaign, directly applying the skills learned in Unit 3 Lesson 19."

    "title": "Detailed Workflow for Building a Participatory Sensing Campaign (Unit 3 Lesson 19)",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 19 provides a step-by-step workflow for building a Participatory Sensing Campaign using the dedicated 'Campaign Authoring Tool' found at `https://portal.thinkdataed.org`. Students first log into the 'IDS Home Page' and select the 'Campaigns tab'. The campaign creation begins with 'Campaign Info', where they input a campaign name, select their class/period, provide a one-sentence description, set the status to 'Running', and disable both 'Data Sharing' and 'Editable Responses' to ensure controlled data collection and monitoring. Next, they click '+Add Survey' to move to the 'Survey Window', where a survey 'Title' (visible to users), an internal 'ID' (not visible), an optional 'Description', and a 'Submission Message' (with a reminder to submit) are defined. The core of the survey is built by repeatedly clicking '+Add Prompt' and configuring 'Prompt Information' for each question. This includes assigning a 'Prompt ID' (variable name), a 'Prompt Label' (displayed name), the 'Question Text', and any 'Additional Prompt Information' specific to the prompt type (e.g., character limits for text prompts). The 'Skippable' option is particularly useful for prompts like photo uploads, accommodating users submitting via browsers. As the campaign is constructed, the tool displays the corresponding XML Code, with an option to 'Highlight XML' for learning. Finally, students 'Submit Campaign' to make it live. Post-submission, they view their campaign on smart devices or the IDS Home Page (remembering to 'Refresh Campaigns') to ensure proper display before beginning the 5-day data collection homework assigned in Unit 3 Lesson 19."

    "title": "Evaluation, Refinement, and Launch of Data Collection in Unit 3 Lesson 19",
    "body": "A critical aspect of Unit 3 Lesson 19 is the iterative process of evaluation and refinement before launching a Participatory Sensing campaign. Following the initial generation of campaign information, students in teams engage in mock-implementation, where they simulate asking each other the survey questions. This exercise is designed to rigorously test whether the questions make sense and will generate data truly relevant to their research and statistical questions. For guidance during this evaluation, teams refer to the evaluative questions outlined in Unit 3 Lesson 18, step 10. Based on the insights gained from mock-implementation, teams propose suggestions for improvement to the class, leading to final adjustments and optimizations of the campaign. Once the campaign design is solidified, the instructor demonstrates the 'Campaign Authoring Tool' (`https://portal.thinkdataed.org`) for its digital creation. After the campaign is built and submitted to the server, students use their smart devices or login to the IDS Home Page to view their new campaign, ensuring they 'Refresh Campaigns' to see the updates. They are encouraged to go through the entire survey to confirm the questions are displayed as intended. The lesson culminates in a practical homework assignment: students will collect data for the next five days using their newly created Participatory Sensing campaign, marking the active data collection phase introduced in Unit 3 Lesson 19."
