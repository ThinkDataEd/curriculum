    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 20, titled 'Online Data-ing,' aims to help students discover the diverse existence, formats, and purposes of data found on the Internet. This lesson introduces foundational concepts such as 'data farms,' which are physical spaces housing high-capacity servers for vast data storage, exemplified by a video tour of a Google data center. Students delve into various online data formats, particularly Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), used for web page display, and Comma-Separated Values (CSV), which is more amenable to data analysis in tools like R. Key vocabulary includes 'data farm,' 'tags' (e.g., `<th>` for HTML table headers), and 'HTML' itself. The lesson uses a Wikipedia page on video games to illustrate how structured data is embedded within HTML and then contrasts this with its CSV representation. A core essential concept is the realization that much information presented on web pages can be transformed into usable data. Through hands-on activities, students explore different websites to identify data, reinforcing the challenge and techniques involved in acquiring online data for analysis. The lesson culminates in homework assignments including Unit 3 Lab 3E (Scraping web data) and Unit 3 Lab 3F (Maps), preparing students for advanced data handling techniques. This unit emphasizes that online data acquisition is often complex, extending beyond simple 'export, upload, import' processes."

    "title": "Unit 3 Lesson 20: Understanding HTML Structure, Tags, and Variable Representation",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 20, 'Online Data-ing,' focuses on understanding the structure of data as it appears on the Internet, particularly through Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). Following an introduction using the *Wikipedia – Video Games* handout (LMR_U3_L20_A), students are guided through the HTML source code associated with the Wikipedia data table. A key element introduced is the concept of 'tags,' which are specific HTML markers. For instance, the table header 'Game' is represented in the source code as `<th>Game</th>`. Students learn that `<th>` is a tag specifically for 'table header,' functioning similarly to a variable name in data analysis environments like RStudio. This section of Unit 3 Lesson 20 also explores how different values for these variables are stored, specifically noting that values are encapsulated between `<td>` and `</td>` tags. The lesson prompts students to consider why data is stored in such a complex, display-oriented manner within HTML, rather than simple spreadsheets, and the challenges this presents when trying to convert it into an R dataframe for analysis. Understanding these HTML `tags` and their role in structuring web content is fundamental to discovering how online information can be transformed into processable data."
