    "title": "Abstract: Unit 3, Section 2 - Would You Look at That?",
    "body": "This section, \"Unit 3, Section 2: Would You Look at That?\", spans 4 instructional days and introduces students to observational studies. It emphasizes that observational studies involve observing subjects and recording outcomes, differing from experiments as subjects are not assigned to controlled groups, which makes it harder to establish causation due to confounding factors. Students will engage in an \"Observational Studies Activity\" from Unit 3 Lesson 5, analyzing data obtained from pictures. Learning objectives cover statistical inference (S-IC 1, S-IC 3, S-IC 6), data science concepts like associations and confounding factors, and RStudio skills for data download, cleaning, and visualization. Real-world applications in fields like economics, psychology, biology, and epidemiology are explored. Language objectives include connecting Participatory Sensing to observational studies, comparing different study types, and distinguishing between causation and association. The \"Lung Capacity of Children\" dataset (fev.csv) is a key data source for practical application."

    "title": "Core Concepts of Observational Studies in Unit 3, Section 2",
    "body": "Unit 3, Section 2, titled \"Would You Look at That?\", focuses on the enduring understanding of observational studies, a data collection method where subjects are observed, and their outcomes are recorded. A crucial distinction from experiments is that it may not be possible to assign subjects to treatment and control groups in observational studies. This fundamental difference means researchers must rely on existing control and treatment groups, which significantly impedes the ability to control for confounding factors—variables that can obscure true relationships. As a result, observational studies are capable of showing associations within data, but they cannot conclusively establish cause and effect relationships. This unit reinforces that drawing causal conclusions typically requires the controlled environment of well-designed experiments."

    "title": "Observational Studies: Differentiating Association and Causation (Unit 3, Section 2)",
    "body": "In Unit 3, Section 2, students learn a critical concept regarding observational studies: while these studies are valuable for identifying associations among variables in data, they are insufficient for inferring cause and effect relationships. This limitation arises because, unlike true experiments, observational studies do not involve random assignment of subjects to treatment and control groups. Consequently, it becomes challenging to control for confounding factors, which are extraneous variables that can influence both the presumed 'cause' and 'effect,' making them appear related when they are not directly causally linked. This section underscores that establishing true causation requires the rigorous methodology of an experiment, where confounding variables can be minimized or accounted for through randomization."

    "title": "Student Engagement through the Observational Studies Activity (Unit 3 Lesson 5)",
    "body": "As a key part of Unit 3, Section 2, student engagement is actively fostered through the \"Observational Studies Activity,\" which is described in Unit 3 Lesson 5. During this activity, students participate by recording information that can be obtained through observing characteristics presented in pictures. The data collected from these observations will then be analyzed to investigate if there are any variables related to the number of friends a person has on social media. This hands-on experience allows students to apply the principles of observational studies directly, practicing data collection and initial analysis to identify potential associations, while simultaneously recognizing the inherent limitations in drawing causal conclusions from such observational data."

    "title": "Statistical and Mathematical Learning Objectives for Unit 3, Section 2",
    "body": "The statistical and mathematical learning objectives for Unit 3, Section 2, \"Would You Look at That?\", are designed to build foundational statistical literacy over 4 instructional days. Students are expected to understand statistics as a process for making inferences about population parameters based on a random sample (S-IC 1). A significant objective is to recognize the purposes of and differences among sample surveys, experiments, and observational studies, and to explain how randomization relates to each (S-IC 3). Additionally, students will develop the ability to critically evaluate reports based on data (S-IC 6), assessing their methodologies and conclusions. These objectives collectively reinforce the necessary statistical thinking required to correctly interpret and distinguish between various data collection methods, with a focus on observational studies."

    "title": "Data Science and Applied Computational Thinking Objectives in Unit 3, Section 2",
    "body": "Unit 3, Section 2, focuses on critical data science and applied computational thinking skills using RStudio. Students will develop an understanding that data derived from observational studies is valuable for identifying associations among variables. A key learning objective is to explain why some variables that are not truly related might appear to be so due to the presence of confounding factors. Practically, students will gain experience downloading data from the Internet that has been collected via an observational study. They will also clean datasets by adding appropriate variable names, create scatterplots to visualize relationships between two variables, and identify potential confounding variables within their analyses, enhancing their practical data analysis capabilities in RStudio."

    "title": "Real-World Relevance and Language Objectives of Observational Studies (Unit 3, Section 2)",
    "body": "Unit 3, Section 2, \"Would You Look at That?\", highlights the real-world connections and practical applications of observational studies across various fields. Economists, psychologists, and biologists frequently conduct observational studies to investigate human behavior and natural phenomena. A notable example is in epidemiology, where observational studies are used to track outbreaks of illnesses and understand people’s behavioral patterns. The language objectives for this section include enabling students to connect the data they gather through Participatory Sensing campaigns to the principles of observational studies. They will also practice comparing and contrasting observational studies with experiments and clearly describing the fundamental relationship between causation and association."

    "title": "Data Collection Methods and Engagement in Unit 3, Section 2",
    "body": "In Unit 3, Section 2, the data collection method for student engagement primarily involves recording information about a set of high school students. This is achieved by observing various characteristics given in pictures. This hands-on data collection directly ties into the \"Observational Studies Activity,\" which is introduced in Unit 3 Lesson 5. During this activity, students analyze the collected data to find associations, such as variables related to the number of social media friends. This method serves to reinforce the core concept of observational studies—gathering data by observing existing situations without active intervention or manipulation. The unit uses this practical exercise to build understanding of how data is collected in real-world observational contexts and to prepare students for analyzing provided datasets, like the \"Lung Capacity of Children\" data."
