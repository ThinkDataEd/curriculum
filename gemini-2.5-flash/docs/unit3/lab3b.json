    "title": "Abstract: Unit 3 Lab 3B - Confound it all!",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lab 3B, titled \"Confound it all!\", guides participants through an observational study focused on the effect of childhood smoking on lung health. The lab introduces methods for finding and importing external data directly from a webpage into R, specifically using the `fev.csv` dataset. Participants learn to clean this data by renaming variables, changing their data types, and recoding categorical values such as gender and smoker status. The lab then delves into data analysis, starting with an exploration of the relationship between age and lung capacity. A key focus is investigating whether smoking impacts lung capacity, with a specific task to identify and consider confounding factors. The lab culminates in an age-stratified comparison of lung capacity between smokers and non-smokers (for 13, 15, and 17-year-olds) to understand how this relationship changes across different age groups, leading to a comprehensive summary of findings supported by plots. This lab emphasizes critical thinking about observational studies and potential confounders."

    "body": "Unit 3 Lab 3B, \"Confound it all!\", instructs users to follow slides, answering questions in blue on the computer and in red in a journal. This lab expands on previous data science experiences by introducing new methods for finding and utilizing data beyond RStudio's built-in datasets or Campaign Manager exports. Participants will engage with an observational study dataset, sourcing it directly from a website rather than through traditional export-upload-import methods. The primary objective is to explore factors associated with an individual's lung capacity. This approach highlights the versatility of R in integrating diverse data sources for analysis. The lab specifically utilizes data from the Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV) study to investigate the impact of childhood smoking on lung health, providing a practical scenario for dealing with real-world observational data and potential confounding variables."

    "title": "Importing External Observational Data in Unit 3 Lab 3B",
    "body": "In Unit 3 Lab 3B, \"Confound it all!\", a key skill developed is the direct import of observational study data from an external webpage into R, bypassing the need for manual download and upload. The specific dataset, `fev.csv`, is accessible via the URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thinkdataed/dataset/main/fev.csv`. To import this data, participants are directed to RStudio's *Environment* tab, where they click *Import Dataset* and then select *From Text (readr)*. The provided URL is then entered into the designated box, followed by clicking *Update*. Crucial import options must be configured: the dataset should be named `lungs`, the *First Row as Names* option must be unchecked, and the *Delimiter* changed to *Whitespace*. These precise steps ensure the `fev.csv` data, originating from the Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV) study, is correctly loaded and ready for subsequent cleaning and analysis within the R environment, setting the foundation for investigating lung capacity factors. This process demonstrates a practical approach to integrating online data."

    "title": "Description of the FEV Dataset and its Origin in Unit 3 Lab 3B",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lab 3B introduces the `lungs` dataset, derived from the `fev.csv` file, which is central to an observational study on lung health. This dataset captures several key variables: `Age` in years, `Lung capacity` measured in liters, `Height` in inches, `Genders` (coded as \"1\" for males and \"0\" for females), and `Smoker` status (coded as \"1\" for smokers and \"0\" for non-smokers). The data originates from the *Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV)* study conducted in the late 1970s. This significant study collected observations from a sample of 654 youths, ranging in age from 3 to 19 years old, residing in or around East Boston. The overarching research question driving the FEV study, and consequently the analysis in Unit 3 Lab 3B, is: \"What is the effect of childhood smoking on lung health?\" Understanding these variables and the study's background is crucial for conducting meaningful analysis and interpreting the findings related to lung capacity. The lab uses this dataset to explore the relationships between these factors."

    "title": "Essential Data Cleaning: Renaming and Type Conversion in Unit 3 Lab 3B",
    "body": "Following the successful import of the `lungs` dataset in Unit 3 Lab 3B, the next critical phase involves cleaning the data to ensure its readiness for analysis. This process begins with accurately naming the variables. The columns must be sequentially named: `\"age\"`, `\"lung_cap\"`, `\"height\"`, `\"gender\"`, and `\"smoker\"`. A significant step in this cleaning phase, as detailed in Unit 1 Lab 1F, involves converting the data types for `gender` and `smoker` variables. Initially, these variables are imported as numeric (`\"1\"` for male/smoker, `\"0\"` for female/non-smoker), but for better interpretability and statistical handling as categorical factors, they need to be changed from *numeric* to *character* type. This transformation is a foundational step, preparing the data for subsequent recoding and analysis to properly investigate the research question about childhood smoking and lung health using the `lungs` dataset from the FEV study."

    "title": "Advanced Data Cleaning: Recoding Categorical Variables for Clarity in Unit 3 Lab 3B",
    "body": "After changing the `gender` and `smoker` variables from numeric to character type in Unit 3 Lab 3B, the next crucial data cleaning step is to recode their values for enhanced clarity and interpretability. For the `gender` variable, the numeric character `\"1\"` needs to be transformed into `\"Male\"`, and `\"0\"` needs to be transformed into `\"Female\"`. Similarly, for the `smoker` variable, the `\"1\"` value representing a smoker should be recoded to `\"Yes\"`, and `\"0\"` representing a non-smoker should be recoded to `\"No\"`. This recoding process, using functions like `recode`, ensures that the categorical variables within the `lungs` dataset are easily understandable and ready for more intuitive analysis and visualization. These steps are essential for accurately addressing the core research question of the lab, which investigates the effect of childhood smoking on lung health, building upon the initial variable naming and type conversion covered in the cleaning phase."

    "title": "Exploring Age and Lung Capacity in an Observational Study in Unit 3 Lab 3B",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lab 3B highlights that the `lungs` data originates from an *observational study*, which inherently means researchers could not ethically assign children to smoking groups. This constraint is a critical point for discussion, as participants are asked to consider why an experiment to test the effects of smoking on children's lungs would be infeasible. Observational studies, however, are invaluable for understanding relationships between variables. The lab prompts an exploration of the relationship between a person's `age` and their `lung_cap` (lung capacity). Participants are asked to hypothesize this relationship, sketching a scatterplot and explaining their reasoning. Subsequently, they will write and run R code to create an `xyplot` of `age` and `lung_cap` using the `lungs` data. The task requires interpreting this plot and describing how the observed relationship between age and lung capacity makes logical sense, setting the stage for deeper investigations into other factors like smoking."

    "title": "The Relationship Between Smoking, Lung Capacity, and Confounding Factors in Unit 3 Lab 3B",
    "body": "A central investigation in Unit 3 Lab 3B focuses on the direct impact of smoking on lung capacity, using the `lungs` dataset from the FEV study. Participants are tasked with creating a plot to address the statistical investigative question: \"Do people who smoke tend to have lower lung capacity than those who do not smoke?\" After generating this plot, they must use it to answer the question, reflecting on whether the answer is surprising and explaining why. This phase of the lab critically introduces the concept of *confounding factors*. Participants are prompted to suggest a possible confounding factor that might influence the observed results, complicating the direct interpretation of the relationship between smoking status and lung capacity. This exercise reinforces the understanding that observational studies, while useful, require careful consideration of external variables that could obscure or distort true causal relationships. The data cleaning steps, including recoding `smoker` status to \"Yes\" and \"No\", are crucial for this analysis."

    "title": "Stratified Analysis: Smoking and Lung Capacity Across Age Groups in Unit 3 Lab 3B",
    "body": "To delve deeper into the complex relationship between smoking and lung capacity and to explore potential confounding, Unit 3 Lab 3B requires a stratified analysis by age. Participants are instructed to create three distinct subsets of the `lungs` data: one containing *only* 13-year-olds, another *only* 15-year-olds, and a third *only* 17-year-olds. For each of these age-specific subsets, code must be written and executed to generate plots that compare the lung capacity of smokers and non-smokers. This comparative analysis across different age groups is critical for observing how the relationship between smoking and lung capacity might change with age. The final step involves describing how this relationship evolves as age increases from 13 to 15 to 17, providing insights into potential age-related confounding or interaction effects within the FEV study data. This layered analysis helps to refine the understanding of the initial research question, acknowledging that associations can vary across demographics."

    "title": "Concluding Insights on Smoking's Impact on Lung Capacity in Unit 3 Lab 3B",
    "body": "The culminating activity in Unit 3 Lab 3B requires participants to synthesize their findings from the `lungs` dataset to address the overarching question: \"Does smoking affect lung capacity? If so, how?\" This final reflection demands comprehensive support for the answers, using appropriate plots generated throughout the lab. Furthermore, it necessitates an explanation of *why* specific variables were included in the plots used to support the conclusions. This exercise reinforces the entire learning journey of Unit 3 Lab 3B, from data import and cleaning (renaming variables to `age`, `lung_cap`, `height`, `gender`, `smoker` and recoding categorical data) to initial exploratory analysis (age vs. lung capacity), and finally, the investigation into smoking's effects, considering potential confounding factors and performing age-stratified comparisons (13, 15, 17-year-olds). The summary emphasizes the importance of robust evidence, careful consideration of observational study limitations, and clear communication of findings from the FEV study."
