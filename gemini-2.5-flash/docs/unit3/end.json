    "title": "Abstract: End of Unit 3 Project on Campaign Data Analysis",
    "body": "This document outlines the \"End of Unit 3 Project: Analyzing Our Own Campaign Data,\" designed for students to analyze data from their class-created Participatory Sensing campaigns. The primary objective is to answer statistical questions previously generated in Unit 3 Lessons 16-18, utilizing RStudio for data analysis. Students will generate graphical representations and numerical summaries, explain their choices, and interpret how these address their chosen statistical questions. The project also requires students to reflect on the sufficiency of their collected data and propose additional data if needed. Ultimately, students will analyze three statistical questions, document their process, including RStudio code, and present their findings in a one-page report to a peer, fostering critical thinking about data collection and interpretation."

    "title": "End of Unit 3 Project: Analyzing Participatory Sensing Campaign Data",
    "body": "The \"End of Unit 3 Project: Analyzing Our Own Campaign Data\" marks the conclusion of Unit 3, challenging students to engage deeply with data analysis. The central objective is for students to select and answer one of the statistical questions they formulated earlier during the Participatory Sensing campaign creation, specifically in Unit 3 Lesson 16. To achieve this, students are mandated to use RStudio to generate both graphical representations and numerical summaries of their collected data. This analysis will directly address their chosen statistical question, demonstrating their ability to process and interpret real-world data from their own class-created campaigns. The project, detailed in the *End of Unit 3 Project: Analyzing Our Own Campaign Data* (LMR_U3_End_of_Unit_Project), emphasizes practical application of statistical tools and methodologies."

    "title": "Data Source and Initial Statistical Question Selection for Unit 3 Project",
    "body": "For the \"End of Unit 3 Project: Analyzing Our Own Campaign Data,\" students will exclusively utilize data collected from their class-created Participatory Sensing campaign. This campaign was initially developed and conceptualized following the Participatory Sensing campaign creation lesson, particularly Unit 3 Lesson 16. The project requires students to refer back to the statistical questions their team and the entire class generated in Unit 3 Lessons 16 through Unit 3 Lesson 18. From this pool of generated questions, students must choose one specific statistical question that directly addresses their class's overarching research question. This selected question will then be the focus of their initial data analysis, requiring identification of relevant variables from their campaign dataset. This step ensures a direct link between the data collected and the analytical objectives."

    "title": "Comprehensive Data Analysis Requirements for the First Statistical Question",
    "body": "As part of the \"End of Unit 3 Project: Analyzing Our Own Campaign Data,\" students must meticulously analyze their class's campaign data to answer a chosen statistical question. This analysis necessitates the creation of both graphical representations and numerical summaries using RStudio. For each analysis, students are required to: 1) Present the plot and corresponding numerical summary; 2) Provide a clear description of what the plot visually conveys; 3) Justify their choice of that particular plot type, explaining its suitability for the data and question; 4) Articulate precisely how both the plot and the numerical summary collectively answer their chosen statistical question; and 5) Include the exact RStudio code used to generate their plot. This detailed approach ensures a thorough and well-documented analytical process, forming a critical component of the project."

    "title": "Evaluating Data Sufficiency and Expanding to Additional Statistical Questions",
    "body": "Following the initial in-depth analysis of one statistical question for the \"End of Unit 3 Project: Analyzing Our Own Campaign Data,\" students are required to critically evaluate their findings. This involves determining if the collected class campaign data were sufficient to fully answer their chosen statistical question. If not, students must propose what additional data would be necessary. This proposal could involve different variables, an alternative data collection approach, gathering data from more participants, or extending the data collection period. Subsequently, students are to select two more statistical questions that also address their class's main research question. They will then analyze and interpret the data for these additional questions, applying the same rigorous methods of graphical representations and numerical summaries using RStudio. This iterative process promotes a deeper understanding of data limitations and the continuous nature of inquiry."

    "title": "Iterative Data Analysis, Report Generation, and Peer Presentation",
    "body": "The \"End of Unit 3 Project: Analyzing Our Own Campaign Data\" encourages students to recognize the dynamic nature of data analysis. During their work, it's common to identify new statistical questions or realize that the data requires cleaning before questions can be accurately answered. Students are prompted to explain if such situations arose with any of their chosen statistical questions. The culmination of this analytical journey is a one-page report. This report must synthesize all analyses, interpretations, and reflections from the project, covering the initial statistical question and the two additional ones. Finally, students are required to present their findings and report to another member of the class who was not part of their original team, fostering peer review and communication of statistical insights. This final stage reinforces the communication aspect of data science, ensuring clarity and comprehension of the analytical results derived from their Participatory Sensing campaign data."

    "title": "Contextualizing the Unit 3 Project: Developing RStudio and Analytical Skills",
    "body": "The \"End of Unit 3 Project: Analyzing Our Own Campaign Data\" serves as a practical application of the skills developed throughout Unit 3, particularly those related to Participatory Sensing and statistical inquiry introduced in Unit 3 Lessons 16-18. The project's core objective is to analyze class-created campaign data using RStudio, creating graphical representations and numerical summaries to answer specific statistical questions. This reinforces the importance of linking data collection to hypothesis testing and the ability to choose appropriate analytical tools. Students learn not only to present their findings but also to explain their methodological choices and critically assess the completeness of their data. The requirement to include RStudio code alongside explanations solidifies their understanding of computational statistics, preparing them for more advanced data science challenges and fostering a comprehensive approach to data analysis."
