    "body": "This document outlines Unit 3 Lab 3A, titled \"The results are in!\", which focuses on analyzing data from a previously conducted experiment. The primary objective is to answer the research question: \"Does the stimulus your class chose change people's perception of time?\" Students will engage in the data cycle, starting by formulating statistical investigative questions, importing experiment data into RStudio, and then performing data analysis by creating plots and calculating numerical summaries. The lab culminates in investigating whether initial results could have occurred by chance using repeated shuffling, and finally, writing a comprehensive report to address the main research question, detailing the experiment methodology and findings. Instructions differentiate between tasks to be completed on the computer (blue text) and those to be recorded in a journal (red text)."

The overarching goal for Unit 3 Lab 3A is to determine: \"Does the stimulus your class chose change people's perception of time?\" Students are instructed to follow accompanying slides, completing questions highlighted in blue on their computers using RStudio, and answering questions in red in their journals. This lab applies the data cycle to interpret experimental findings from a prior class activity."

    "title": "Context of Unit 3 Lab 3A: Previous Experiment and Core Research Question",
    "body": "Prior to Unit 3 Lab 3A, the class conducted an experiment designed to investigate how a particular stimulus might influence an individual's perception of time. This experiment involved two groups: one receiving a specific treatment, and another serving as a control group without the treatment. Unit 3 Lab 3A builds directly upon this foundational experiment by utilizing its collected data within the data cycle framework. The central research question that students will address throughout Unit 3 Lab 3A is: \"Does the stimulus your class chose change people's perception of time?\" This question guides all subsequent analytical tasks."

    "title": "Unit 3 Lab 3A: Developing Statistical Questions and Importing Data to RStudio",
    "body": "In Unit 3 Lab 3A, students begin by addressing the research question, \"Does the stimulus your class chose change people's perception of time?\". The first task (Red Question 1) requires students to formulate two statistical investigative questions that will help answer this primary research question. Immediately following this, students must export their experiment data, upload it, and then import it into RStudio for analysis (blue instruction). If difficulties arise in generating effective statistical questions, the lab advises loading the data and examining its variables to inform question development, asking, \"How would I use these variables to answer the research question?\" This step is crucial for setting up the analytical phase of Unit 3 Lab 3A."

    "body": "A key phase in Unit 3 Lab 3A involves analyzing the collected experiment data to address the research question: \"Does the stimulus your class chose change people's perception of time?\" Students are instructed to create appropriate plots (blue instruction) to visually represent their data and answer their statistical investigative questions. Concurrently, they must calculate appropriate numerical summaries (blue instruction) that further quantify the relationships observed. After generating these visualizations and summaries, students are required (Red Question 2) to write a few sentences interpreting their findings from these plots and summaries. This analytical stage uses the data cycle to extract meaningful insights from the experimental results."

    "title": "Unit 3 Lab 3A: Repeated Shuffling for Chance Analysis and Final Report",
    "body": "As Unit 3 Lab 3A progresses towards conclusions, a critical question is posed: \"Is it possible your initial results occurred by chance alone?\" To investigate this, students are directed (Red Question 3) to write and execute code using repeated shuffling. The purpose of this shuffling is to determine the likelihood that the typical difference observed between the two experimental groups happened purely by random chance. Following this analysis, students must create a plot (Red Question 4) and use it to justify their answer regarding the role of chance. Finally, students will formulate a comprehensive report (Red Question 5) that utilizes all conducted plots and analysis to definitively answer the overarching research question of Unit 3 Lab 3A: \"Does the stimulus your class chose change people's perception of time?\", ensuring to describe the experimental methodology."

    "title": "Unit 3 Lab 3A: Differentiating Computer and Journal Tasks",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lab 3A, \"The results are in!\", provides clear instructions for task completion. Students are to follow along with the provided slides. Specific tasks and questions marked in blue font are to be completed on the computer, primarily involving data manipulation, plotting, and calculations within RStudio. Conversely, questions presented in red font require written responses or code generation to be recorded in the student's journal. This distinction ensures an organized workflow throughout Unit 3 Lab 3A, guiding students through formulating statistical questions (Red Q1), interpreting plots and summaries (Red Q2), conducting chance analysis with repeated shuffling (Red Q3, Q4), and finally, writing a concluding report (Red Q5) that addresses the central research question."

    "title": "Unit 3 Lab 3A: Applying the Data Cycle to Answer the Stimulus Research Question",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lab 3A is designed to engage students in the full data cycle, specifically to analyze the research question: \"Does the stimulus your class chose change people's perception of time?\" This involves a structured approach starting with formulating statistical investigative questions (Red Q1), which are crucial for breaking down the broad research question. Students then proceed to the data collection and organization phase by importing their experiment data into RStudio. The core analysis involves creating appropriate plots and calculating numerical summaries (blue instructions). The lab emphasizes a deeper understanding by requiring interpretation of these findings (Red Q2) and, significantly, investigating the role of chance using repeated shuffling (Red Q3, Q4) before ultimately presenting a final report (Red Q5) that synthesizes all findings to answer the initial research question."

    "body": "In Unit 3 Lab 3A, practical application of statistical software is central to addressing the research question: \"Does the stimulus your class chose change people's perception of time?\" A critical initial step (blue instruction) involves preparing the experiment data by exporting, uploading, and then importing it into RStudio. This ensures the data is ready for analysis. Once the data is loaded, students are tasked with using RStudio to create appropriate plots (blue instruction) to visually represent their findings. Simultaneously, they must calculate appropriate numerical summaries (blue instruction) to quantify key aspects of the data. These RStudio-based operations are fundamental for generating the evidence needed to answer the statistical investigative questions and, subsequently, the main research question of Unit 3 Lab 3A."

    "body": "Unit 3 Lab 3A extends beyond basic data analysis to address the crucial question of statistical significance: \"Is it possible your initial results occurred by chance alone?\" To answer this, students are required (Red Question 3) to implement repeated shuffling techniques through code to assess the probability of observing the typical difference between groups purely by chance. The outcome of this shuffling must then be visualized in a plot (Red Question 4) which serves as a justification for their conclusion about chance. The culmination of Unit 3 Lab 3A is a comprehensive report (Red Question 5) that synthesizes all previous analysis, including plots and numerical summaries, to provide a well-supported answer to the main research question: \"Does the stimulus your class chose change people's perception of time?\" This report must also include a description of how the experiment was conducted."
