    "title": "Abstract: Unit 3 Lesson 4 - Predictions, Predictions",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 4, titled \"Predictions, Predictions,\" focuses on developing students' critical reading and analytical skills. The primary objective is for students to critically analyze an article on time perception, anticipate data visualizations from a class experiment, and make informed predictions about its outcome. Key activities include reading the PsyBlog article \"Time Perception: How Your Brain Experiences Time,\" engaging in team discussions about the article's findings, and collectively deciding on a specific treatment for a previously designed class experiment on time perception. Students will then use the \"Experiment Predictions\" handout (LMR_U3_L4) to formalize their theories and predictions regarding the experiment's data distribution and results, considering the research question: \"How does our perception of time change when exposed to a stimulus?\" The lesson also emphasizes collaborative sharing and discussion of these predictions using strategies like 'Anonymous Author' and a modified 'Two Cents' approach. The actual conduct of the experiment is scheduled for Unit 3 Lesson 5, building directly on the predictions made in this lesson."

    "title": "Materials and Core Article Analysis for Unit 3 Lesson 4: Time Perception",
    "body": "The materials for Unit 3 Lesson 4, \"Predictions, Predictions,\" are central to achieving its learning objectives. Students will engage with the article 'Time Perception: How Your Brain Experiences Time' from PsyBlog, available at [https://www.spring.org.uk/2025/01/time-perception-brain.php](https://www.spring.org.uk/2025/01/time-perception-brain.php). This article serves as a primary resource for critical reading and analysis. In addition to the article, the 'Experiment Predictions' handout (LMR_U3_L4) is provided, which students will use to document their forecasts for the upcoming class experiment. The lesson initiates by guiding students through a critical reading of the 'Time Perception' article, prompting them to answer specific questions. These questions delve into identifying the observed subjects, measured variables, the statistical inquiries researchers aimed to address, the data collection methods employed (e.g., case studies, behavioral experiments, imaging technologies), and the key claims made by the article, such as the influence of psychological, physiological, and environmental factors on time perception. Students will also consider potential statistical questions inspired by the article, like changes in time perception with age."

    "title": "Analyzing Research and Formulating Predictions in Unit 3 Lesson 4",
    "body": "In Unit 3 Lesson 4, \"Predictions, Predictions,\" students deepen their analytical skills by critically examining the 'Time Perception: How Your Brain Experiences Time' article. After individual reading, students collaborate in teams to consolidate their responses to key questions. They identify who was observed (people) and what variables were measured (perception of time). They also determine the statistical questions (how time perception is affected by stimuli/factors), who collected the data (researchers), and the methods used (case studies, behavioral experiments, advanced imaging). Crucially, students pinpoint the article's claims about multiple factors influencing time perception (psychological, physiological, environmental) and brainstorm potential statistics, such as the proportion of people reporting age-related changes in time perception. This team-based discussion is reinforced by a 'Whip Around' activity to share responses across the class, ensuring a shared understanding. This process lays the groundwork for students to then develop their own theories and predictions for the class experiment, drawing inspiration from the article's methodologies and findings, thus linking foundational research analysis to their own experimental design and predictive thinking. The essential concept is that designing an experiment requires careful decisions about what and how to measure."

    "title": "Designing the Class Experiment and Selecting a Treatment in Unit 3 Lesson 4",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 4, \"Predictions, Predictions,\" moves from critical article analysis to the practical considerations of experiment design. Building upon a class experiment designed in a previous lesson, students are tasked with collectively selecting an actual 'treatment' for their experiment on time perception. This decision-making process is crucial, allowing students to apply their understanding of experimental variables. The lesson encourages students to draw inspiration from the 'Time Perception' article for potential stimuli or to innovate with novel ideas. Examples of suitable stimuli include various music genres, lighting conditions (lights off), physical activities (e.g., holding arms out), relaxation techniques, or simple instructions like 'heads down' or 'eyes closed.' A critical constraint for the selected treatment is its feasibility within a 50-60 minute class period, avoiding excessive preparation or execution time. This step directly addresses the essential concept that experiment design involves making thoughtful decisions about what to measure and how, ensuring the chosen treatment aligns with the class experiment's research question: \"How does our perception of time change when exposed to a stimulus?\" This collaborative selection process prepares students to form their predictions, understanding the specific conditions under which data will be collected."

    "title": "Formulating Theories and Predictions for the Class Experiment in Unit 3 Lesson 4",
    "body": "In Unit 3 Lesson 4, \"Predictions, Predictions,\" a crucial phase involves students testing their theories by making concrete predictions about the data and outcomes of their class experiment. The lesson formally introduces the vocabulary term 'theory,' defining it as 'an idea used to explain a situation.' This theoretical framework underpins their predictive efforts. The central research question guiding the class experiment is displayed: \"How does our perception of time change when exposed to a stimulus?\" To stimulate initial thoughts, students are polled on whether they anticipate differences in estimated minute lengths between treatment and control groups, and if so, the magnitude of these differences. Following this, students work in pairs to complete the 'Experiment Predictions' handout (LMR_U3_L4). This handout prompts them to consider the expected distribution of time perceptions, with anticipated answers suggesting distributions likely centered around 60 seconds but including shorter and longer values. Students are guided to think about appropriate data visualization plots, such as histograms, dotplots, or boxplots, to represent these distributions. This entire process emphasizes the scientific method's predictive aspect, where initial ideas are formalized into testable hypotheses and visualizable outcomes, making each chunk understandable by itself without external context and ensuring key information redundancy."

    "title": "Visualizing Data and Discussing Prediction Distributions in Unit 3 Lesson 4",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 4, \"Predictions, Predictions,\" guides students through the crucial process of visualizing potential experimental data and discussing the distributions of their predictions. After defining 'theory' and establishing the research question (\"How does our perception of time change when exposed to a stimulus?\"), students engage with the 'Experiment Predictions' handout (LMR_U3_L4). A key aspect of this handout is considering what the distribution of time perceptions might look like. Students are expected to anticipate distributions that will likely have a concentration of data points closer to 60 seconds, representing an accurate perception of a minute, but also include values that are both shorter and longer. This exercise encourages foresight in data analysis. The lesson explicitly mentions that appropriate plots for visualizing such data would include histograms, dotplots, or boxplots, thereby introducing students to relevant statistical tools before data collection. Prior to completing the handout, students participate in a poll to gauge their initial beliefs about whether there will be differences between treatment and control groups and, if so, the perceived magnitude of these differences. This collective inquiry into expected outcomes and appropriate visualizations for the class experiment, designed and prepared for Unit 3 Lesson 5, is fundamental to developing a comprehensive understanding of experimental data and its representation."

    "title": "Collaborative Review and Discussion of Predictions in Unit 3 Lesson 4",
    "body": "A significant component of Unit 3 Lesson 4, \"Predictions, Predictions,\" involves the collaborative review and discussion of student predictions for the class experiment. After students complete their 'Experiment Predictions' handout (LMR_U3_L4) in pairs, their work is shared with the entire class using an 'Anonymous Author' strategy, fostering an environment of constructive feedback rather than individual critique. Each student team is then allocated approximately two minutes to discuss the shared predictions. To ensure active participation and critical engagement from all teams, a modified 'Two Cents' strategy, where each team receives one 'cent' or token, is employed. To 'turn in' their token, teams must contribute comments or ask pertinent questions about the shared student work. This method guarantees that every team contributes to the collective discussion, enriching the understanding of various predictive approaches and potential data outcomes. The lesson culminates by informing students that the actual experiment, where they will estimate the length of one minute under chosen conditions, will be conducted during Unit 3 Lesson 5. This structured discussion reinforces the objective of anticipating data visualizations and making informed predictions, preparing them for the data collection phase."

    "title": "Concluding Predictions and Preparing for Experiment in Unit 3 Lesson 4",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 4, \"Predictions, Predictions,\" effectively concludes the phase of theoretical analysis and prediction-making, setting the stage for the hands-on experiment. The lesson's activities, from critically reading the 'Time Perception' article and defining 'theory' to completing the 'Experiment Predictions' handout (LMR_U3_L4), are all geared towards students formulating robust hypotheses. They have engaged in deep discussions about the research question, \"How does our perception of time change when exposed to a stimulus?\", and considered the potential distributions of data, including appropriate statistical plots like histograms, dotplots, and boxplots. The collaborative sharing of predictions, facilitated by 'Anonymous Author' and 'Two Cents' strategies, ensures that all students have processed various perspectives on experimental outcomes. A key takeaway is the understanding that designing an experiment requires careful decisions about measurement. As the lesson wraps up, students are explicitly informed that the actual execution of the class experiment – where they will estimate the length of a minute under the chosen treatment – will take place in Unit 3 Lesson 5. Additionally, 'Class Scribes' will summarize the three most important topics of the day, reinforcing key learning points and solidifying the link between theoretical prediction and empirical investigation."
