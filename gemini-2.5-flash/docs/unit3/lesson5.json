    "title": "Abstract: Overview of Unit 3 Lesson 5 - Time Perception Experiment",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 5, titled 'Time Perception Experiment,' focuses on engaging students in a collectively designed experiment to explore how the perception of time changes when exposed to a stimulus. The lesson's objective is to enable students to design and carry out a statistical experiment, drawing upon essential concepts of experimental design previously introduced in Unit 3 Lesson 2. Key materials include RStudio's `stopwatch()` function for precise time measurement and the IDS ThinkData Ed App or a browser-based survey tool for data entry. The experiment involves students estimating a minute while either engaging in a specific stimulus (treatment group) or sitting calmly (control group), recording their estimates, and then inputting the data into a 'Time Perception' survey. The lesson emphasizes the importance of experimental design principles, including random assignment for establishing causality and the critical role of a control group. The collected data is slated for analysis in Unit 3 Lab 3A, which directly follows this lesson and precedes Practicum 1."

    "title": "Unit 3 Lesson 5: Objective, Concepts, and Research Question for Time Perception Experiment",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 5, 'Time Perception Experiment,' sets forth a clear objective: students will actively participate in designing and executing a collective experiment. This hands-on approach reinforces essential concepts, particularly that designing and conducting an experiment is crucial for answering specific statistical questions of interest. Students are encouraged to recall elements of an experiment discussed in Unit 3 Lesson 2 from their DS journals. The primary research question guiding this experiment is: 'How does our perception of time change when exposed to a stimulus?' To facilitate this, the lesson utilizes RStudio's `stopwatch()` function for accurate time measurement and the IDS ThinkData Ed App or a browser-based survey-taking tool for data collection. The lesson begins by preparing students to use RStudio for precise measurements of their time estimates."

    "title": "Practical Implementation: RStudio Stopwatch and One-Minute Estimation in Unit 3 Lesson 5",
    "body": "In Unit 3 Lesson 5, the practical application of the 'Time Perception Experiment' is thoroughly demonstrated. Students will utilize RStudio to achieve a precise measurement of their time estimates. The lesson initiates this by demonstrating the `stopwatch()` function in RStudio. The instructor types `stopwatch()` into the console, and a student volunteer then stands, ready to estimate the length of one minute without any visual aid from a clock. Once the volunteer believes a minute has elapsed, they press the enter/return key on the keyboard to stop the timer and reveal their estimate. This demonstration serves as a crucial guide, showing all students precisely how they will measure their individual one-minute estimates during the experiment. The research question, 'How does our perception of time change when exposed to a stimulus?', underpins this practical exercise."

    "title": "Conducting the Time Perception Experiment: Treatment and Control Protocols in Unit 3 Lesson 5",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 5 outlines the detailed procedures for conducting the 'Time Perception Experiment,' differentiating between treatment and control groups. For the treatment group, subjects receive a specific stimulus. For example, if the stimulus is standing with open arms, the estimate begins when the student starts the `stopwatch()` function and engages in this action, ending when they press enter/return in RStudio to stop the timer. Conversely, students in the control group simply sit at their desks with their eyes closed, running the `stopwatch()` function and stopping it when they believe a minute has passed. The entire experiment is conducted systematically, emphasizing the effective use of team roles to ensure accuracy and correct execution. Each student is required to use a computer and the `stopwatch()` function to record their individual estimate of one minute."

    "title": "Data Recording and Future Analysis in Unit 3 Lesson 5's Time Perception Experiment",
    "body": "Following the execution of the experiment in Unit 3 Lesson 5, the focus shifts to data recording and preparing for subsequent analysis. Each student, after running the RStudio `stopwatch()` function to measure their one-minute estimate, is instructed to meticulously record this estimate in their DS journal. Upon the experiment's completion, all students are then required to enter their collected data into the 'Time Perception' survey. This survey is accessible either through the IDS ThinkData Ed App on iOS or Android devices or via a browser-based tool at https://portal.thinkdataed.org. Students are explicitly informed that the analysis of the results from this experiment will be the subject of Unit 3 Lab 3A, titled 'The results are in!,' which immediately follows this lesson."

    "title": "Essential Experimental Design: The Role and Importance of Random Assignment (Unit 3 Lesson 5)",
    "body": "A critical component of experimental design, highlighted in Unit 3 Lesson 5's teacher's note, is random assignment. This technique is employed when the goal is to determine whether a specific treatment directly *causes* changes in an outcome variable. Its importance lies in its ability to create a 'balance' between the groups participating in the experiment. By randomly assigning subjects, the only systematic difference between the groups, on average, is that one receives the treatment while the other does not. Consequently, if a significant change is observed in the outcome variable, it can be confidently attributed to the treatment, establishing a causal link. This understanding is fundamental to drawing valid conclusions from experiments like the Time Perception Experiment."

    "title": "Distinguishing Causal Relationships: Examples and Discussion from Unit 3 Lesson 5",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 5 includes a crucial discussion point for teachers regarding the distinction between causal and non-causal statements, essential for understanding experimental outcomes. For instance, the headline 'Straight A's in high school may mean better health later in life' is identified as *not causal*, requiring re-writing for causality. In contrast, 'Murder rates affect IQ test scores: Study' is deemed *causal*, with explanations varying. 'Microbe linked to Alzheimer's Disease' is also *not causal*, while 'Luckiest people 'born in summer'' is considered *causal*. This exercise, part of the check for understanding, helps students critically analyze statements and recognize the strong evidence required to infer causation, which is a core objective of designing experiments like the 'Time Perception Experiment' in Unit 3 Lesson 5."

    "title": "The Critical Role of the Control Group and Concluding Activities in Unit 3 Lesson 5",
    "body": "The importance of a control group is thoroughly addressed in Unit 3 Lesson 5, particularly within the teacher's guide for assessing student understanding. The control group is vital because it provides a baseline, allowing researchers to measure the effects of the treatment group against a comparable, untreated group. Without a control group, it's impossible to know what would have happened if no treatment had been administered. The example of a new flu vaccine illustrates this: without a control group, even if the treatment group shows improvement, one cannot be certain they wouldn't have improved naturally. Concluding activities for Unit 3 Lesson 5 include 'Class Scribes' where one team discusses the three most important topics of the day. The lesson then transitions directly to 'LAB 3A: The results are in!', which students must complete prior to Practicum 1, reinforcing the analysis phase of their experiment."
