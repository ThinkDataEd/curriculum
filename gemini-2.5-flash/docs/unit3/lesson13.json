    "title": "Abstract: Unit 3 Lesson 13 - The Confidence Game",
    "body": "This lesson, \"The Confidence Game,\" from Unit 3 Lesson 13, introduces students to informal confidence intervals as a method for estimating unknown population parameters based on statistics from random samples. The core concept emphasizes that due to inherent uncertainty in estimation, it is more effective to provide a range of plausible values rather than a single point estimate. Students engage in an interactive game where they create intervals for various numerical questions, aiming for 90% confidence that the true answer lies within their chosen range. The lesson covers essential vocabulary such as \"inferences,\" \"interval,\" and \"confidence interval.\" Through the game and subsequent discussion, students observe that their initial confidence often leads to narrower, less successful intervals, highlighting the need for wider intervals to increase confidence. The activity culminates in a formal definition of confidence intervals and sets the stage for further exploration of this concept in Unit 3 Lesson 14. Materials include \"The Confidence Game\" handout (LMR_U3_L13) and a dotplot for recording scores."

    "title": "Unit 3 Lesson 13 Objective: Estimating Population Parameters with Informal Confidence Intervals",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 13, titled \"The Confidence Game,\" aims to teach students how to construct informal confidence intervals. The primary objective is for students to understand how to make estimates about population parameters using statistics derived from random samples. This lesson introduces the crucial concept that when estimating population parameters, uncertainty is always present. Therefore, providing a range of plausible values is generally more effective and realistic than attempting to provide a single, exact value. This foundational understanding prepares students for deeper statistical inference. Key materials for this lesson include \"The Confidence Game\" handout (LMR_U3_L13) and a dotplot displayed on the board or poster paper to track student performance. The lesson emphasizes the use of random sampling methods to obtain unbiased statistics, which are essential for making reliable inferences about a population."

    "title": "Essential Statistical Concepts and Vocabulary for Confidence Intervals",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 13, \"The Confidence Game,\" introduces students to several essential statistical concepts and vocabulary terms critical for understanding estimation. A fundamental concept highlighted is that inherent uncertainty exists when estimating population parameters. Consequently, it is statistically more sound to express estimates as a range of plausible values, rather than a single point estimate. Key vocabulary includes \"inferences,\" defined as the process of drawing conclusions about an underlying population based on a sample, and \"interval,\" referring to a data type measured along a scale with equal distances between points. The central term, \"confidence interval,\" is introduced as an estimated range of values likely to contain an unknown population parameter, calculated from sample data. This lesson builds upon students' prior knowledge of sampling by reminding them that random sampling methods are necessary to produce unbiased sample statistics, which in turn allow for valid inferences about a population."

    "title": "The Role of Random Sampling and Statistical Estimation in Unit 3 Lesson 13",
    "body": "In Unit 3 Lesson 13, \"The Confidence Game,\" students revisit the importance of random sampling as a prerequisite for making valid inferences about a population. The lesson begins by reminding students that biased sampling methods lead to sample statistics that cannot be generalized to the population of interest. To obtain unbiased statistics and enable reliable conclusions, random sampling methods must be employed. Following this, the lesson explores the concept of \"estimating,\" engaging students in a brainstorm for synonyms like guess, approximation, or projection. In a statistical context, \"to estimate\" is precisely defined as providing a range of values that are confidently expected to include the true population parameter. This approach addresses the inherent uncertainty in population parameter estimation, advocating for a range of plausible values—known as a \"confidence interval\"—rather than a single, potentially inaccurate, point estimate."

    "title": "Introduction to The Confidence Game Activity: Estimating with Confidence Intervals",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 13 introduces students to an interactive activity called \"The Confidence Game,\" designed to provide hands-on experience with statistical estimation. The game's premise is to answer a series of questions, each with a numerical answer, but instead of providing an exact guess, students are tasked with creating an \"interval,\" or a range of possible values. The crucial instruction is for students to be \"90% confident\" that the true value of the answer falls within their chosen interval. This exercise directly illustrates the lesson's objective of understanding informal confidence intervals for estimating population parameters. To prepare students, the lesson includes an example using the question, \"How tall is the Empire State Building, in feet (including the spire at the very top)?\" Students are asked to write down an interval, discuss their ranges, and then compare them to the actual height of 1,454 feet. This example helps set the stage for how success in identifying the true value within an interval will be measured during the main game."

    "title": "Pre-Game Example: The Empire State Building and Interval Estimation in Unit 3 Lesson 13",
    "body": "As part of Unit 3 Lesson 13, \"The Confidence Game,\" an illustrative example featuring the Empire State Building is used to introduce the concept of interval estimation. Students are posed the question, \"How tall is the Empire State Building, in feet (including the spire at the very top)?\" Their task is to write down an \"interval,\" or a range of values, that they believe contains the building's true height. Following this, students are encouraged to share their intervals, prompting a discussion on similarities and differences, particularly focusing on the width of the intervals. For instance, comparing a student's wide interval (e.g., 500 to 2000 feet) with a narrower one (e.g., 1100 to 1400 feet) can lead to discussions about individual confidence levels and how they influence the chosen range. After the discussion, the actual height of 1,454 feet is revealed, and a poll is taken to see how many students' intervals successfully captured this true value. This hands-on example helps students grasp what it means to create an interval that is likely to include an unknown population parameter, prior to playing the main game."

    "title": "Gameplay and Rules of \"The Confidence Game\" in Unit 3 Lesson 13",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 13, \"The Confidence Game,\" involves students playing a game where they estimate numerical answers using confidence intervals. After an introductory example, students receive \"The Confidence Game\" handout (LMR_U3_L13) and are given approximately 5 minutes to complete it, allowing about 30 seconds per question. The rules, which are printed on the handout and reiterated by the instructor, are crucial for the activity. Firstly, every question must be answered with an interval, not a single number. Secondly, students should choose their interval with the goal of being \"90% confident\" that the true answer falls within it. Thirdly, no reference tools, such as cell phones or computers, are permitted. Fourthly, a question is deemed \"correct\" only if the true answer is located inside the student's interval. Finally, the winner of the game is determined by who correctly answered the most questions, with narrower intervals serving as a tie-breaker. This structure encourages students to balance confidence with the precision of their estimates."

    "body": "Following the completion of \"The Confidence Game\" handout (LMR_U3_L13) in Unit 3 Lesson 13, students engage in a peer-grading process. Each student partners with another to exchange handouts and assess each other's work. The fundamental criterion for a \"correct\" response is whether the actual, true value for a given question falls within the interval provided by the student. To facilitate this grading, the instructor displays the official answers for all 10 questions. These include: Mickey Mouse debut in 1928; lowest California temperature at -45 degrees Fahrenheit; 1,715 TV series aired in 2014; Earth-Moon distance of 238,900 miles; 69 children born to one mother; Wright brothers' first flight in 1903; Rihanna's 23 Number 1 Billboard Dance Club Hits as of June 2015; Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith married for 27 years as of June 2025; a 41-hour cross-country road trip from Los Angeles to New York City; and Dodger Stadium capacity of 56,000 fans. After grading, students record the total number of correct responses on their partner's handout."

    "title": "Analyzing Performance in \"The Confidence Game\": The Discrepancy Between Expected and Actual Confidence",
    "body": "Following the grading of \"The Confidence Game\" in Unit 3 Lesson 13, a critical class discussion takes place to analyze student performance in estimating population parameters. Students are reminded that the goal was to be 90% confident for each of the 10 questions. This implies an expectation that each student should have gotten approximately 9 out of 10 questions correct if their confidence level truly matched their performance. However, class results typically reveal a significant disparity, with many students scoring much lower than 9 correct responses. This common outcome prompts discussion questions such as, \"Did anyone in the class get exactly 9 correct?\" or \"What is the typical number of correct responses for our class?\" The usual finding is that the typical score is considerably lower, often 4 or less, demonstrating that students tend to be more confident in their estimates than they should be, leading them to create narrower intervals that frequently miss the true value."

    "title": "Visualizing Confidence: Dotplot Analysis and Strategies to Widen Intervals in Unit 3 Lesson 13",
    "body": "In Unit 3 Lesson 13's \"The Confidence Game,\" after students tally their correct responses, a dotplot titled \"Number Correct\" is created on the board or poster paper. Each student records their score, visually representing the class's collective performance. This dotplot facilitates a discussion about the distribution of scores, particularly focusing on how many students achieved the target of 9 correct answers (representing 90% confidence). The typical observation is that the actual number of correct responses is often much lower than 9. This leads to crucial questions such as, \"Why is our typical score so much lower than 9?\" The answer, as students discover, is that they tend to be overconfident, resulting in them creating narrower intervals that fail to capture the true values. The discussion then progresses to explore strategies for improving confidence: \"How could we increase our level of confidence?\" The conclusion is that to increase the likelihood of capturing the true value, students would need to use wider intervals, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in estimation."

    "title": "Formalizing Confidence Intervals and Preparing for Unit 3 Lesson 14",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 13, \"The Confidence Game,\" culminates in a formal definition of the \"confidence interval,\" building upon the hands-on experience of the game. Students are reminded of the statistical definition of estimation: providing a range of values that are confidently expected to include the true population parameter. This range of values, which students have been creating throughout the game, is explicitly named a **confidence interval**. The preceding discussions, particularly those revealing that students' initial intervals were often too narrow due to overconfidence, reinforce the importance of understanding how interval width relates to confidence. The lesson concludes by setting the stage for Unit 3 Lesson 14, where students will continue to deepen their understanding of confidence intervals, moving beyond informal estimations to more formal methods. This ensures a continuous learning progression in statistical inference. The lesson also includes a homework assignment, asking students to describe a confidence interval in their own words and explain its statistical utility."

As part of the conclusion, a designated team of class scribes is tasked with briefly discussing what they consider to be the three most important topics covered during the day's lesson. This activity encourages students to synthesize and articulate their key takeaways regarding informal confidence intervals and estimation. For homework, students are assigned to write a description of what a confidence interval is in their own words and explain its significance in statistics. This reinforces their understanding of the concept developed through the game and class discussions. Looking forward, the lesson explicitly states that students will continue their exploration of confidence intervals in Unit 3 Lesson 14. This planned progression ensures that the foundational concepts introduced in \"The Confidence Game\" are built upon, moving towards more advanced statistical applications."
