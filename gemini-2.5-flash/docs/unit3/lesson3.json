    "title": "Abstract: Unit 3 Lesson 3 - The Imperative of Randomized Assignment in Experimentation",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 3, titled 'Let’s Try an Experiment!', guides students through a crucial exploration of randomized assignment's significance in experimental design. The primary objective is for students to grasp that establishing cause-and-effect relationships is contingent upon proper randomization, without which experiments risk being compromised by confounding variables. The lesson commences with a deceptive demonstration: a 'height treatment' experiment where participants are non-randomly grouped, with taller students intentionally placed in the treatment group and shorter ones in the control. This deliberate flaw swiftly exposes how pre-determined groupings create confounding factors, invalidating any conclusions about the treatment's efficacy and underscoring why random assignment is indispensable. Following this initial activity, students engage in discussions to identify appropriate methods for randomizing subjects, emphasizing the necessity of creating similar groups to prevent alternative explanations for observed outcomes. The lesson then challenges students to design their own experiment to investigate 'How does our perception of time change when exposed to a stimulus?' This design phase involves defining research questions, identifying subjects, proposing random assignment strategies—including leveraging tools like RStudio's `sample()` function for practical implementation—and determining outcome variables. The collective consensus on these design elements will lead to the randomized assignment of students into treatment and control groups, setting the stage for the experiment's execution in Unit 3 Lesson 4. The overall aim is to solidify the understanding that randomized assignment is not merely a procedural step but a fundamental requirement for drawing valid, unbiased conclusions from experimental data."

    "body": "The primary objective of Unit 3 Lesson 3, 'Let’s Try an Experiment!', is to impart a deep understanding of randomized assignment's critical role in experimental design. Students will learn that randomized assignment is an essential prerequisite for definitively establishing cause-and-effect relationships between a treatment and an outcome. Without it, experiments are vulnerable to confounding variables, which are alternative explanations for an observed effect that are not due to the treatment itself. For instance, if groups are not randomly formed, pre-existing differences between them could be mistakenly attributed to the treatment. The lesson aims for students to be able to identify potential confounding variables in non-randomized scenarios and to suggest appropriate randomized assignment methods. The learning activity begins with a hands-on demonstration involving a 'height treatment' where students are deliberately non-randomly assigned to treatment and control groups based on their initial height, directly illustrating how such biases lead to confounding factors. This initial experiment uses a simple measuring tape as a material to demonstrate the outcome variable (height) and highlight the flaws of non-random assignment. This foundational understanding is crucial for designing experiments that yield valid and reliable conclusions, moving beyond mere correlation to true causation."

    "title": "Demonstrating Confounding: The Flawed Height Experiment in Unit 3 Lesson 3",
    "body": "In Unit 3 Lesson 3, 'Let’s Try an Experiment!', students are introduced to the concept of randomized assignment through a practical, albeit intentionally flawed, experiment. The lesson begins by posing the question: 'Why do we need randomized assignment?' To answer this, students are told about a hypothetical 'treatment' that makes people taller. The class is divided into two groups: a treatment group that receives the 'treatment' and a control group that does not. Crucially, the teacher deliberately assigns taller students to the treatment group and shorter students to the control group. The intention is to measure heights after the 'treatment' using a measuring tape. This setup is designed to elicit one of two outcomes: either students protest the biased grouping, or they proceed with a silly 'treatment' like waving a ruler or chanting 'grow, grow, grow!' Regardless of the protest, the pre-determined outcome, where the 'treatment' group appears taller because they were taller to begin with, clearly demonstrates a confounding factor. Confounding factors are variables that offer alternative explanations for the effect of a treatment on an outcome, making it impossible to attribute the results solely to the treatment. This hands-on experience serves as a powerful illustration of why non-randomized assignment invalidates conclusions about cause-and-effect, setting the stage for discussions on proper experimental design."

    "title": "Principles of Valid Experimental Design: Overcoming Confounding with Random Assignment in Unit 3 Lesson 3",
    "body": "Following the illustrative, flawed height experiment in Unit 3 Lesson 3, 'Let’s Try an Experiment!', a critical discussion ensues about how to properly assign subjects to experimental groups. Students are guided to recognize that using any pre-existing characteristics to decide group membership, as was done with height, inevitably leads to confounding factors and invalidates the experiment's conclusions. The core principle established is the need for randomized assignment, which ensures that treatment and control groups are similar in all respects, on average, before the treatment is applied. Questions like 'How should students be put into groups?' and 'What about flipping a coin?' prompt students to consider unbiased methods. The lesson clarifies that while random assignment won't create exactly identical groups, it ensures that each group should have approximately the same balance of characteristics as the overall class. This similarity is paramount because, as students learn, if groups are not similar, then 'something else might be the cause of the response changing,' rather than the treatment itself. This directly addresses the lesson's objective of understanding why randomized assignment is required to determine cause-and-effect, by actively exploring the pitfalls of non-random methods and the benefits of true randomization."

    "title": "Designing a New Experiment: Investigating Time Perception with Stimulus in Unit 3 Lesson 3",
    "body": "Building on the foundational understanding of randomized assignment and confounding variables developed through the height experiment, Unit 3 Lesson 3 progresses to empower students to design their own experiment. The central research question they will investigate is: 'How does our perception of time change when exposed to a stimulus?' This hands-on design task challenges students to apply the principles of experimental integrity they've just learned. The experiment will involve students attempting to determine the length of one minute without any time-aids. Some students will be subjected to a chosen stimulus (to be decided later), while others will receive no stimulus, forming the treatment and control groups, respectively. Students are tasked with recording their design elements in their DS journals, addressing key questions: What is the specific research question? Who are the subjects? How will subjects be randomly assigned to groups? What is the outcome variable and its unit of measurement? The class then discusses these responses to reach a consensus, ensuring a shared, robust experimental design. This collaborative effort culminates in preparing for the actual experiment, which will be conducted in Unit 3 Lesson 4, highlighting the transition from understanding theoretical concepts to practical application in experimental science."

    "title": "Implementing Random Assignment and Preparing for Experiment Execution in Unit 3 Lesson 3",
    "body": "As Unit 3 Lesson 3 concludes, the theoretical understanding of randomized assignment transforms into practical implementation for the student-designed time perception experiment. After the class reaches a consensus on the research question, subjects, random assignment method, and outcome variable (from the previous design step), the next crucial step is to assign students to their respective treatment and control groups. The lesson introduces a concrete method for achieving this randomization: using the `sample()` function in RStudio. For example, if there are 30 students, `sample(1:30, size = 15, replace = FALSE)` can randomly select 15 students for the treatment group, with the remaining 15 forming the control group. This approach ensures an unbiased distribution, directly addressing the core objective of the lesson – to use randomized assignment to enable the determination of cause-and-effect without the interference of confounding variables. This practical application of randomization prepares the students for the actual conduct of their experiment in Unit 3 Lesson 4. Furthermore, a 'Class Scribes' activity wraps up the lesson, where one team summarizes the three most important topics of the day, reinforcing the key takeaways related to experimental design, confounding variables, and the indispensable nature of randomized assignment for scientific inquiry."
