    "title": "Abstract: Unit 3 Lesson 17 - Creating a Participatory Sensing Campaign",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 17, titled 'Creating Our Own Participatory Sensing Campaign', guides students through the complete process of designing a new Participatory Sensing campaign. The primary objective is for students to collaboratively create a campaign and survey on a class-chosen topic. Key concepts include understanding that Participatory Sensing requires survey questions to be completed when specific 'triggers' occur, and that research questions provide the overall direction for the campaign. Students review the definition of Participatory Sensing, differentiate it from one-time surveys, and analyze existing campaigns like Unit 3 Campaign Food Habits. The lesson progresses through team-based brainstorming and class consensus to select a campaign topic, formulate a research question, and define a data collection 'trigger'. Materials include the 'Food Habits Campaign Questions' handout (LMR_U3_L17_A) and the 'Campaign Creation Brainstorm' handout (LMR_U3_L17_B). The lesson concludes with a homework assignment where students classify their newly designed campaign into 'Individual', 'Groups of people', or 'Community' categories based on its focus."

    "title": "Unit 3 Lesson 17: Objective and Essential Materials for Campaign Creation",
    "body": "The core objective of Unit 3 Lesson 17, 'Creating Our Own Participatory Sensing Campaign', is to empower students to design a novel Participatory Sensing campaign and its associated survey. This campaign will focus on a topic of collective interest chosen by the class. To facilitate this hands-on creation, students will utilize two essential instructional materials: the 'Food Habits Campaign Questions' handout, referenced as LMR_U3_L17_A, which serves as an example for analysis, and the 'Campaign Creation Brainstorm' handout, designated as LMR_U3_L17_B, which guides the brainstorming and development process. These resources are critical for understanding the structure and elements required for a successful Participatory Sensing initiative."

    "title": "Essential Concepts: Triggers and Research Questions in Participatory Sensing",
    "body": "Central to the understanding and creation of a Participatory Sensing Campaign, as explored in Unit 3 Lesson 17, are two essential concepts: 'triggers' and 'research questions'. For a Participatory Sensing Campaign, survey questions are not merely answered once; instead, they must be completed whenever they are 'triggered' by a specific event or condition. This continuous, event-driven data collection distinguishes Participatory Sensing from traditional surveys. Complementing this, research questions are vital as they provide the overarching direction and purpose for the entire campaign, guiding what information is sought and why. Together, triggers define 'when' data is collected, and research questions define 'what' data is needed to answer a specific inquiry."

    "title": "Defining Participatory Sensing: A Citizen-Powered Approach to Data Collection",
    "body": "In Unit 3 Lesson 17, students are introduced to a formal definition of Participatory Sensing, a concept fundamental to data science. At its core, Participatory Sensing is the process of data collection and subsequent interpretation. It significantly emphasizes the active involvement of citizens and various community groups. These participants engage in sensing and documenting aspects of their surroundings – specifically 'where they live, work, and play'. The scope of this involvement can vary widely, ranging from individual, private observations to the aggregation of data from hundreds or thousands of people, revealing broad patterns across an entire city or region. This approach underscores the power of collective data contributions from individuals within a community."
  },
  {
    "title": "The People-Centric Nature of Participatory Sensing and Data Determination",
    "body": "Further expanding on the definition from Unit 3 Lesson 17, Participatory Sensing is inherently people-centric, initiating and concluding with individuals and community members. This citizen-powered approach allows the type of information collected, its organization, and ultimate utilization to be determined in various ways. It can follow a traditional model, where a centrally organized body dictates these aspects, or, more distinctly, a 'deliberative manner' where the collection of participants themselves make these determinations. This latter method particularly highlights the innovative nature of Participatory Sensing and underscores the importance of leveraging widely available and familiar technology, making data collection accessible to a broad audience. This enables individuals to actively shape the data collection process."

  {
    "title": "Differentiating Participatory Sensing Campaigns from One-Time Surveys",
    "body": "During Unit 3 Lesson 17, students activate prior knowledge by recalling their past engagements with Participatory Sensing campaigns. Examples of campaigns they have participated in include Unit 3 Campaign Food Habits, Unit 3 Campaign Time Use, and Unit 3 Campaign Stress/Chill. A crucial distinction is made between these ongoing data collection efforts and one-time surveys. Campaigns like 'Personality Color' and 'Time Perception' are clarified as surveys, not Participatory Sensing campaigns, because their data was collected only once and not over an extended period or triggered by recurring events. This highlights that a defining characteristic of a Participatory Sensing Campaign is the collection of data repeatedly over time, often in response to specific triggers."
  },
  {
    "title": "Analyzing the Unit 3 Campaign Food Habits Questions (LMR_U3_L17_A)",
    "body": "As a preparatory step in Unit 3 Lesson 17 for creating their own campaign, students analyze the 'Food Habits Campaign Questions' handout, LMR_U3_L17_A. In teams, students discuss the number and types of questions, noting their survey-like nature (e.g., open-ended, single-choice). They identify that these questions need to be answered 'each time they eat a snack,' which serves as the campaign's trigger. Furthermore, students recognize that the participants themselves are responsible for collecting their own data. This analysis helps them understand how an existing Participatory Sensing Campaign is structured, especially the relationship between survey questions, triggers, and data collection mechanisms."
  },
  {
    "title": "The Role of Trigger Events in Participatory Sensing Campaigns",
    "body": "In Unit 3 Lesson 17, the concept of a 'trigger event' is emphasized as a fundamental element that differentiates Participatory Sensing Campaigns from standard surveys. While the questions within a Participatory Sensing Campaign are essentially survey questions, their data collection is contingent upon a specific event. For instance, in the Unit 3 Campaign Food Habits, the trigger event is 'each time they eat a snack.' This means participants complete the survey questions not once, but every time this predefined event occurs. This mechanism allows for the collection of data over time, capturing patterns and changes, and is central to how Participatory Sensing illuminates real-world behaviors and environments."

    "title": "Setting the Stage for Collaborative Participatory Sensing Campaign Design",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 17 transitions students into the practical phase of designing their own Participatory Sensing Campaign. Teams are assigned specific roles with defined duties to maintain focus and productivity throughout the lesson. The campaign development process emphasizes consensus or majority rule within each team for decision-making at every step. Students are informed that they will be creating a class-wide Participatory Sensing Campaign on a topic of their interest. This collaborative effort will be guided by the 'Campaign Creation Brainstorm' handout, LMR_U3_L17_B, providing a structured framework for brainstorming and developing their campaign elements."

  {
    "title": "Campaign Creation - Round 1: Selecting a Class Topic of Interest",
    "body": "The first critical step in creating a new Participatory Sensing Campaign during Unit 3 Lesson 17 is the selection of a class-wide 'topic of interest'. In 'Round 1' of the campaign development process, teams engage in a discussion about various potential topics. These can include personal hobbies, areas of interest, or specific places or processes they wish to understand better. Prompts encourage students to consider 'where they live, work, or play.' Examples include 'practicing cello' as a hobby, 'the environment' as an area of interest, or 'our school' as a place. The goal is for all students within a group to agree on a topic, and subsequently, the entire class decides on one overarching topic that will form the basis of their new Participatory Sensing Campaign."
  },
  {
    "title": "Campaign Creation - Round 2: Formulating a Research Question",
    "body": "Following the selection of a class topic in Unit 3 Lesson 17, 'Round 2' of the campaign creation process focuses on formulating a 'research question'. Teams are tasked with considering what specific questions they might ask about their chosen topic of interest. This step is crucial because, as an essential concept, research questions provide the overall direction for a Participatory Sensing Campaign. For example, if the class topic was 'practicing cello,' a relevant research question might be 'How can I improve my playing?' or 'How can I practice more effectively?' After teams develop their individual research questions, they share them with the class, and a single, unified research question is collectively chosen to guide the new Participatory Sensing Campaign."
  },
  {
    "title": "Campaign Creation - Round 3: Defining Data Collection Triggers",
    "body": "In 'Round 3' of the Participatory Sensing Campaign creation process during Unit 3 Lesson 17, students focus on a critical component: defining the 'trigger' for data collection. This involves examining what kind of data needs to be collected to answer their chosen research question and then discussing the possible events or conditions that will 'trigger' the completion of the survey questions. Teams deliberate on the optimal timing for these triggers, such as 'every day at 8 am,' 'whenever they practice the cello,' or 'whenever they see an advertisement.' For example, if the campaign is about practicing cello, a fitting trigger would be 'whenever you play the cello,' allowing data collection multiple times a day. The class ultimately decides on one specific trigger for their new campaign, which students record in their DS Journals."

  {
    "title": "Homework: Classifying the Newly Created Participatory Sensing Campaign",
    "body": "The homework assignment for Unit 3 Lesson 17 challenges students to classify their collaboratively designed Participatory Sensing Campaign. Using the class-determined topic, research question, trigger event, and the discussion around data collection, students must categorize their campaign under one of three classifications: (A) Individual, (B) Groups of people, or (C) Community. This classification requires justification, prompting students to think critically about the scope and focus of their data collection. This task reinforces the understanding of who or what the campaign aims to learn about, directly connecting to the overarching purpose of Participatory Sensing."
  },
  {
    "title": "Campaign Classification Categories: Individual and Groups of People",
    "body": "As part of the homework in Unit 3 Lesson 17, students classify their new Participatory Sensing Campaign into one of three categories. The 'Individual' category (A) is appropriate if the campaign's primary focus is to learn about 'only one person.' A clear example of this is the 'cello campaign' mentioned in the lesson, where data collection primarily serves to understand one individual's practice habits. The 'Groups of people' category (B) is used when the campaign aims to gather insights about 'lots of people.' Examples provided for this category include previous campaigns such as Unit 3 Campaign Food Habits, Unit 3 Campaign Stress/Chill, and Unit 3 Campaign Time Use, all of which collected data from multiple students in the class to understand collective patterns."
  },
  {
    "title": "Campaign Classification Category: Community and Guiding Principle",
    "body": "Continuing the classification homework from Unit 3 Lesson 17, the third category for Participatory Sensing Campaigns is 'Community' (C). This classification applies when the campaign's objective is to learn about broader communal aspects or to address community-wide issues. Examples include a campaign seeking to map the locations of all churches within a neighborhood, or initiatives designed to encourage behavioral changes like reducing littering or conserving water. The guiding principle for determining the appropriate category – Individual, Groups of people, or Community – is to consider the question: 'Who or what will we learn about?' This central question directs students to evaluate the scale and target of their campaign's data collection and analysis."

  {
    "title": "Consolidating Campaign Development: Topic, Research Question, and Trigger",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 17 provides a comprehensive framework for students to understand and implement Participatory Sensing. The collaborative process of selecting a class topic of interest, formulating a precise research question, and defining a clear trigger event is fundamental to creating a functional campaign. These three elements are interconnected and mutually dependent: the topic sets the general area of inquiry, the research question specifies what needs to be discovered within that topic, and the trigger dictates when and how the necessary data will be collected. This structured approach, facilitated by the 'Campaign Creation Brainstorm' handout (LMR_U3_L17_B), ensures that the newly designed Participatory Sensing Campaign is well-defined and actionable."
  },
  {
    "title": "Reinforcing Essential Concepts: The Interplay of Research Questions and Triggers",
    "body": "Throughout Unit 3 Lesson 17, the importance of 'research questions' and 'triggers' as essential concepts for Participatory Sensing Campaigns is consistently reinforced. Research questions are the intellectual drivers, providing the overall direction and purpose for the data collection, ensuring that the collected information is relevant to a specific inquiry. Concurrently, triggers are the operational mechanism, dictating *when* the survey questions must be completed. This continuous, event-driven data collection, in contrast to one-time surveys, is what enables Participatory Sensing to uncover patterns over time and in specific contexts. Understanding this interplay is critical for designing effective, data-rich campaigns that yield meaningful insights."

  {
    "title": "Reflecting on Participatory Sensing as a Citizen-Powered Data Approach",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 17 culminates in a deep appreciation for Participatory Sensing as a citizen-powered methodology for data collection and interpretation. The lesson highlights that Participatory Sensing, whether through private observations or vast community data aggregation, ultimately begins and ends with people. The hands-on campaign creation process, from selecting a topic to defining triggers, emphasizes the deliberative role of participants in shaping their own data collection efforts. This approach leverages widely available technology to empower individuals and groups to actively engage in understanding 'where they live, work, and play,' thereby contributing to a collective understanding of patterns that shape their world, as articulated in the provided definition."
