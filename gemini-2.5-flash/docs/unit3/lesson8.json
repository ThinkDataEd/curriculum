    "title": "Abstract: Understanding Confounding Factors in Observational Studies",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 8, titled 'Monsters that Hide in Observational Studies,' aims to educate students on the critical role of confounding factors in observational studies. The primary objective is to highlight why such studies can only establish associations between variables, never causation. Students will revisit the concept of confounding factors, initially introduced in Unit 3 Lesson 3, which are 'extra' variables providing alternative explanations for observed relationships. The lesson employs a step-by-step diagrammatic explanation using an example of umbrella sales and street crime to illustrate how a confounding variable like 'weather' can influence both observed variables, thereby undermining a direct causal link. Furthermore, students explore the 'Spurious Correlations' website (tylervigen.com) to identify numerous seemingly strong, yet non-causal, associations. Through this interactive activity, students practice identifying variables, describing associations, interpreting data, and proposing potential confounding factors. The lesson ultimately reinforces the fundamental principle that while observational studies can reveal variables that are 'associated,' only controlled experiments can establish 'cause-and-effect' relationships. This foundational understanding prepares students for subsequent activities, including Unit 3 Lab 3B and Unit 3 Lesson 9."

    "title": "Unit 3 Lesson 8 Objective: Identifying Confounding Factors and Limiting Causation Claims",
    "body": "The core objective of Unit 3 Lesson 8 is for students to comprehend confounding factors and their significant impact on observational studies. Students will learn that these 'extra' variables can obscure true relationships, making it impossible to conclude causation from observational data. Instead, such studies can only reveal associations between variables, meaning that two variables are 'associated' when their values relate in some way, but one doesn't necessarily cause the other. This lesson builds upon prior knowledge of causation and association, emphasizing that rigorous experimental design is essential to establish cause-and-effect. Key vocabulary introduced or revisited includes 'cause,' 'confounding factors,' and 'associated.' The lesson highlights that confounding factors provide alternative explanations for observed effects, impacting both explanatory and response variables in observational studies. Materials required for the lesson include computers and access to the 'Spurious Correlations' website."

    "title": "Defining Confounding Factors and Distinguishing from Causation",
    "body": "In Unit 3 Lesson 8, the concept of 'confounding factors' is central to understanding the limitations of observational studies. A confounding factor is an 'extra' variable that was not accounted for and provides an alternative explanation for an observed relationship between two other variables. Students are reminded of a previous scenario from Unit 3 Lesson 6, where they examined the relationship between a student's GPA and the number of social media friends. While it appeared that higher GPAs correlated with more friends, students correctly identified that the number of friends does not 'cause' a higher GPA. This example serves to underscore that a simple correlation does not imply causation. The lesson reiterates the definition of confounding factors, first introduced in Unit 3 Lesson 3, as variables related to both the explanatory and response variables in an observational study, making it difficult to determine a direct cause-and-effect relationship. These factors are crucial because they can lead to misleading conclusions if not properly considered."

    "title": "Illustrating Confounding Factors with the Umbrella Sales and Street Crime Example",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 8 uses a practical example to vividly demonstrate the impact of confounding factors: the statement, 'Research suggests that a rise in umbrella sales leads to decreased street crime.' Students, working in teams, are challenged to identify a confounding variable that could be related to both increased umbrella sales and decreased street crime. The lesson then progresses through a series of diagrams to explain this phenomenon. Initially, an arrow shows the stated link between 'a rise in umbrella sales' and 'decreased street crime.' Step 2 introduces a confounding factor, such as 'weather,' showing that rainy weather leads to people buying more umbrellas. Step 3 adds an arrow from 'Weather' to 'Street Crime Down,' illustrating the well-known fact that bad weather reduces outdoor criminal activity. This progression ultimately questions the original direct link, revealing that 'buying umbrellas' is likely not the 'cause' of decreased street crime. Instead, 'weather' acts as a confounding factor, influencing both variables and offering a more plausible alternative explanation for the observed association."

    "title": "Concluding the Confounding Factors Example: Association Versus Causation",
    "body": "Following the step-by-step diagrammatic explanation in Unit 3 Lesson 8, the lesson concludes the umbrella sales and street crime example by solidifying the distinction between 'association' and 'causation.' After demonstrating how 'weather' acts as a confounding factor, the original perceived causal link between umbrella sales and decreased street crime is effectively nullified. The lesson emphasizes that due to the interference of outside variables, it's inaccurate to claim that buying umbrellas 'causes' a decrease in street crime. Instead, the correct conclusion is that a rise in umbrella sales is 'associated' with decreased street crime. This means that the values of one variable relate to the values of the other in some way, but without a direct cause-and-effect mechanism. This crucial takeaway reinforces the lesson's main objective: observational studies can identify associations, but they lack the control needed to confidently establish causation, which requires carefully designed experiments."

    "title": "Exploring Spurious Correlations: Random Associations Without Causation",
    "body": "In Unit 3 Lesson 8, students transition from theoretical examples to real-world, albeit misleading, data by exploring the 'Spurious Correlations' website created by Tyler Vigen, accessible at tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations. This online resource serves as a powerful tool to illustrate that strong statistical associations between variables often occur purely by chance and do not imply a causal link. The site presents numerous graphs depicting seemingly correlated explanatory and response variables, which are, in reality, entirely unrelated in terms of cause and effect. An example highlighted in the lesson shows that as cheddar cheese consumption in the US increases, solar power generated in Haiti also increases. This serves as a clear demonstration that such correlations are coincidental and do not suggest that US cheese eating habits influence Haitian energy production. The website effectively reinforces the lesson's core message: correlation does not equal causation, especially in observational data."

    "title": "Student Activity: Analyzing Spurious Correlations and Identifying Confounders",
    "body": "A key hands-on activity in Unit 3 Lesson 8 involves students actively engaging with the 'Spurious Correlations' website. After understanding the concept of random associations, students are tasked with exploring the website, selecting a graph that interests them, and then documenting their findings in their DS journals. The activity requires them to answer several critical questions: identifying the two variables, determining if the association is positive or negative, interpreting the plot in context, and recording the data points in a spreadsheet format suitable for tools like RStudio (details available via a 'View details' link). Furthermore, students must create a hand-drawn scatterplot and describe the strength of the association. Crucially, they must decide whether the explanatory variable 'causes' the response variable. If they conclude 'no causation,' which will be the case for most examples on the site, they are then challenged to draw a diagram, similar to the one used in the umbrella sales example, proposing possible confounding factors that might indirectly explain the observed association. This exercise solidifies their understanding of association, causation, and confounding variables."

    "title": "Example Walkthrough: Fruit Spending, Stock Prices, and Identifying Confounders",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 8 provides an example walkthrough of the 'Spurious Correlations' activity, using the correlation between 'Annual US household spending on fresh fruits' and 'the Canadian National Railway Company's stock price (CNI).' This example demonstrates how to approach the student journal questions. It identifies a 'positive association' due to the similar increasing shape of the lines, leading to the interpretation that 'as more US households purchase fresh fruits, the CNI stock price goes up.' The lesson explicitly states that despite this association, causation cannot be concluded because the data does not originate from a controlled experiment. The example answers reinforce that the two variables are associated but not causally linked. Finally, it guides students to draw a diagram proposing potential confounding factors for this specific, spurious correlation, such as 'overall economic health' or 'consumer confidence,' which could influence both household spending and stock market performance. This detailed example serves as a model for students to follow in their own analyses of spurious correlations, emphasizing the critical role of confounding factors."

    "title": "Reinforcing Causation vs. Association in Observational Studies",
    "body": "A primary takeaway from Unit 3 Lesson 8 is the definitive distinction between 'causation' and 'association,' especially concerning observational studies. The lesson consistently emphasizes that observational studies, due to the presence of uncontrolled variables and the potential for confounding factors, can only establish that variables are 'associated' with one another. This means that changes in one variable tend to occur with changes in another, but it does not imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship. Conversely, the lesson stresses that 'causation' can only be confidently concluded when a rigorously designed experiment is performed, where researchers actively manipulate variables and control for external influences. At the end of the lesson, students share their findings from the 'Spurious Correlations' activity with partners, discussing their chosen graphs, the nature of the relationship (direct or inverse), and most importantly, whether a causal link exists. This reinforces the lesson's core message: correlation is not causation, and the limitations of observational studies must always be considered when interpreting data."

    "title": "Preparing for Next Steps: Lab 3B and Further Learning on Confounding",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 8 not only covers crucial concepts about confounding factors but also sets the stage for upcoming learning activities. The lesson concludes by summarizing its key objectives, particularly the understanding that causation is exclusive to experiments, while associations are the domain of observational studies. To further solidify these concepts, students are directed to complete Unit 3 Lab 3B, titled 'Confound it all!,' which is designed to provide practical application and deeper exploration of confounding factors. Following Lab 3B, students will then proceed to Unit 3 Lesson 9, indicating a continuous learning path focused on statistical literacy. The lesson also includes a 'Class Scribes' segment, where one team of students summarizes the day's three most important topics, encouraging active recall and peer learning. This structured progression ensures that the foundational knowledge gained in Unit 3 Lesson 8 is reinforced and built upon in subsequent modules."
