    "title": "Evaluating Treatment Efficacy: Interpreting Simulation Outcomes",
    "body": "A pivotal phase of the 'Practicum: TB or Not TB' (Unit 3) is the interpretation of the simulation results to evaluate Streptomycin's efficacy. Using the distribution generated from the chance model (the 300 shuffled percentages), students must discern which of two propositions provides the most reasonable explanation for the actual data observed in Sir Austin Bradford Hill's study: i. The first proposition suggests that Streptomycin significantly outperforms bed rest as a tuberculosis treatment, thereby implying that the outcome is dependent on the treatment received. ii. The second proposition posits that the observed differences between treatment groups are attributable solely to chance, meaning Streptomycin might not be effective, and that treatment and outcome are independent variables. Students are required to state their chosen explanation and provide a thorough justification based on their simulation's output, thus drawing conclusions about the treatment's impact."
