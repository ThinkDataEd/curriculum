    "title": "Introducing Surveys Through Family Feud in Unit 3 Lesson 9",
    "body": "To introduce the concept of surveys in Unit 3 Lesson 9: Survey Says…, the lesson begins with an engaging activity centered around the popular television game show *Family Feud*. Students watch a clip from the 'Fast Money' segment, where a winning family competes for an additional $20,000 (or $10,000 in older versions). The game involves two family members attempting to achieve a combined score of 200 points by guessing the most common responses to five survey questions. For instance, if asked, 'What animal is a common pet?', typical answers might be 'dog' or 'cat.' The first player has 20 seconds, and the second has 25 seconds, to provide different answers. This activity provides a real-world, relatable context for understanding how surveys function as a data collection tool, setting the stage for deeper exploration of survey methodology."

    "title": "Analyzing Survey Data: Family Feud Activity in Unit 3 Lesson 9",
    "body": "Following the introduction to *Family Feud*, Unit 3 Lesson 9: Survey Says… directs students to critically analyze the game show's use of surveys. While watching the 'Fast Money' video clip, students are prompted to answer specific questions in their DS journals. These questions include determining the number of people surveyed (Answer: 100), identifying the population represented in the survey (Answer: Single men), counting the number of survey questions asked (Answer: 5), and interpreting the host's phrase 'survey said.' The phrase means that 'X' number of the 100 surveyed individuals provided that specific response. This exercise immediately connects the entertainment of *Family Feud* to the practical application of surveys as a data collection method, demonstrating how 'self-reported' data from a sample population is gathered and presented, laying the groundwork for understanding survey structure."

    "title": "Formal Definition and Components of Surveys in Unit 3 Lesson 9",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 9: Survey Says… formalizes the understanding of surveys after an initial brainstorming session. Students learn that a **survey** is a data collection method characterized by data being **self-reported**, meaning participants provide their own answers directly. Effective surveys are composed of several key elements: they typically involve **questionnaires** or a carefully structured series of questions designed to elicit specific information. These questions are posed to a **representative sample** of the population of interest, ensuring that the collected data accurately reflects the larger group. Crucially, surveys rely on **carefully worded questions** that are unambiguous and relevant to the statistical questions being addressed. This structured approach ensures that the data collected is reliable and useful for drawing meaningful conclusions, reinforcing the lesson's essential concept that well-crafted questions are paramount."

    "title": "Differentiating Open-Ended and Closed-Ended Questions in Unit 3 Lesson 9",
    "body": "A critical aspect of survey design covered in Unit 3 Lesson 9: Survey Says… is understanding the two main types of questions used: **open-ended questions** and **closed-ended questions**. Open-ended questions provide a free-response or text-based approach, allowing participants to answer in their own words without predefined constraints. This format is valuable for gathering detailed, qualitative insights. In contrast, closed-ended questions present a fixed set of choices from which participants must select. These can include multiple-choice options, Yes/No questions, or rating scales, making the data easier to quantify and analyze. The lesson emphasizes that the choice between these question types depends on the specific data collection goals and the nature of the information sought, highlighting their distinct roles in a survey's effectiveness."

    "title": "Categorizing Survey Question Types: An Activity in Unit 3 Lesson 9",
    "body": "In Unit 3 Lesson 9: Survey Says…, students engage in a hands-on activity to solidify their understanding of open-ended and closed-ended questions. Working with a partner, they categorize various question formats as either open-ended or closed-ended. Examples include 'Multiple choice' (closed), 'Write a paragraph' (open), 'Yes/No' (closed), 'Comments' (open), 'Essays' (open), 'On a scale from 1 to 5' (closed), 'Choose from a list' (closed), 'Write a sentence' (open), and 'Check a box' (closed). This practical exercise reinforces the definitions of each question type and helps students recognize their application in real survey scenarios. A 'Whip Around' sharing session ensures that all students make necessary corrections and fully grasp the distinctions, underscoring the importance of selecting appropriate question formats for effective data collection in surveys."

    "title": "The Data Cycle and Initiating Survey Design in Unit 3 Lesson 9",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 9: Survey Says… transitions from understanding question types to the practical application of survey design, linking back to the fundamental Data Cycle. Students review the Data Cycle, which serves as a guiding framework for any data collection and analysis project. To introduce the process of conducting surveys, the class embarks on a practice scenario centered around the research question: 'What are ‘families’ in the United States?' Students receive the 'Designing a Survey' handout (LMR_U3_L9), where they fill in 'Families' as the Research Topic and the stated question as the Research Question. This step emphasizes that a clear research question is the starting point for any survey, guiding the subsequent formulation of statistical and specific survey questions, which must be carefully worded and self-reported."

    "title": "Class-Led Survey Design: From Research to Statistical Questions in Unit 3 Lesson 9",
    "body": "Continuing the survey design practice in Unit 3 Lesson 9: Survey Says…, the class collectively works on the left side of the 'Designing a Survey' handout. Using the initial research question, 'What are ‘families’ in the United States?', students brainstorm a statistical question. A possible example is, 'What is the typical family size in the United States?' This step highlights that defining 'family' is crucial, as different interpretations will influence the survey questions. Next, the class determines three survey questions designed to answer the chosen statistical question. The emphasis is on creating questions that are unambiguous and directly address the statistical inquiry. Examples include 'How many siblings do you have?' and 'How many people live with you?' This process reinforces the principle that survey questions must precisely match the statistical question to gather relevant and 'self-reported' data."

    "title": "Refining Survey Questions and Team Collaboration in Unit 3 Lesson 9",
    "body": "In Unit 3 Lesson 9: Survey Says…, the importance of precise and unambiguous survey questions is further emphasized. After the class brainstorms initial survey questions, such as 'How many siblings do you have?', the lesson suggests actually collecting data for that question. This immediate feedback helps students identify potential vagueness (e.g., clarifying if half-siblings or step-siblings should be included), allowing for question revision. Once the class agrees on three clear survey questions for their statistical inquiry, students transition to working in teams. Each team is tasked with formulating their own statistical question related to the broader research question 'What are ‘families’ in the United States?', and then developing three matching survey questions. These team-designed questions must include both 'open-ended questions' and 'closed-ended questions,' showcasing different question types learned earlier."

    "title": "Team-Based Survey Design, Sharing, and Homework in Unit 3 Lesson 9",
    "body": "The final stage of the survey design activity in Unit 3 Lesson 9: Survey Says… involves student teams applying their knowledge to create comprehensive survey components. Each team develops a unique statistical question that addresses the overarching research topic of 'families' in the United States. Following this, they formulate three corresponding survey questions, ensuring that each question utilizes a different type—incorporating both 'open-ended questions' and 'closed-ended questions' as practiced earlier. Teams then share their statistical questions and associated survey questions with the entire class, fostering peer learning and diverse perspectives on survey design. For homework, students select one of their team's survey questions and rewrite it in three different ways, employing three distinct question types, such as 'multiple choice,' 'write a paragraph,' and 'Yes/No,' reinforcing the lesson's focus on carefully worded questions and varied data collection methods."
