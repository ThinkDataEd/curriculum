    "title": "Abstract: Evaluating a Participatory Sensing Campaign in Unit 3 Lesson 18",
    "body": "Unit 3 Lesson 18, titled 'Evaluating Our Own Participatory Sensing Campaign,' guides students through the critical process of assessing a Participatory Sensing Campaign they have collaboratively developed. The primary objective is for students to formulate meaningful statistical questions that can be answered by the collected data and to conduct a thorough evaluation of their campaign's design. This includes reviewing initial classifications, ensuring feasibility, and considering the ethical implications of data collection and sharing. Students revisit campaign elements such as the topic, research question, trigger, and data type. Key activities involve creating and refining survey questions (Round 4) and then generating relevant statistical questions (Round 5) that the campaign aims to address. A comprehensive class discussion on evaluation criteria covers the variability of answers, class-wide participation, trigger frequency, ethical considerations like privacy, and the overall capacity of the survey questions to yield data sufficient for answering the statistical questions. The lesson emphasizes that statistical questions are fundamental guides for any Participatory Sensing Campaign, and rigorous evaluation prior to implementation ensures the campaign is both reasonable and ethically sound, potentially fostering social and civic change. Materials include the 'Campaign Creation' handout from Unit 3 Lesson 17 and class campaign information from Unit 3 Lesson 16."

    "title": "Objective and Essential Concepts of Unit 3 Lesson 18: Campaign Evaluation Fundamentals",
    "body": "The core objective of Unit 3 Lesson 18, 'Evaluating Our Own Participatory Sensing Campaign,' is to equip students with the skills to craft impactful statistical questions and to critically evaluate the Participatory Sensing Campaign they have collaboratively designed. This rigorous evaluation ensures the campaign's effectiveness and ethical integrity before its actual implementation. Key materials supporting this lesson include the 'Campaign Creation' handout (LMR_U3_L17_B), which was first introduced in Unit 3 Lesson 17, and the foundational Class Campaign Information established during Unit 3 Lesson 16. An essential concept underpinning this lesson is the understanding that statistical questions serve as the guiding force for any Participatory Sensing Campaign, directing its focus towards learning about a community or individuals. Furthermore, the lesson emphasizes the crucial need to evaluate these campaigns proactively, prior to their implementation, to confirm their reasonableness, feasibility, and ethical soundness. This upfront assessment is vital for designing a successful and responsible data collection effort within the framework of a Participatory Sensing Campaign."

    "title": "Initial Campaign Review and Feasibility in Unit 3 Lesson 18",
    "body": "In Unit 3 Lesson 18, the class begins by reviewing homework where teams shared their classifications of the Participatory Sensing Campaign. This initial phase involves a class discussion to justify classifications, with a critical focus on feasibility. It is crucial for the campaign to be carried out by the whole class, meaning any campaign initially classified as 'Individual' must undergo revision to ensure broader participation. The discussion also addresses practical feasibility concerns, such as whether the trigger for data collection is so rare that it would yield insufficient data, or if the survey questions are overly intrusive, posing ethical issues. A central promise of Participatory Sensing Campaigns is their potential to drive social and civic change. Teams are prompted to reflect on whether their current campaign aims to achieve this, or if it can be modified to foster such impact. Importantly, campaigns considered feasible for class-wide implementation typically fall under 'groups of people' or 'community' categories, rather than the 'individual' classification. If a Participatory Sensing Campaign is currently in the 'individual' category, it must be adapted to fit a broader category before proceeding to further development rounds, ensuring it aligns with the collective nature of a class-led Participatory Sensing Campaign and its potential for wider impact."

    "title": "Developing Survey Questions (Round 4) in Unit 3 Lesson 18",
    "body": "Continuing the development of the Participatory Sensing Campaign in Unit 3 Lesson 18, students progress to Round 4, a crucial step in defining the campaign's data collection strategy. After the class has collectively decided on a specific trigger for data collection and the general type of data needed, teams utilize the 'Campaign Creation' handout from Unit 3 Lesson 17 to formulate survey questions. The primary goal of Round 4 is to generate a comprehensive list of questions that will be posed whenever the predefined trigger event occurs. Students are encouraged to be creative and brainstorm a wide array of potential data points, considering all possible information that could be collected during such an event. For instance, in a Participatory Sensing Campaign focused on practicing an instrument, survey questions might include: 'How long did you practice?', 'What did you play?', 'How would you rate your practice session: 1 to 5?', or 'Any thoughts or comments about your practice?'. This creative process aims to maximize the potential insights gained from the Participatory Sensing Campaign by ensuring a diverse set of data variables are considered for future analysis. Once teams have developed their initial survey questions, they will share them with the class, leading to a collaborative decision on a refined set of no more than 10 survey questions for the Participatory Sensing Campaign."

    "title": "Evaluating and Refining Survey Questions in Unit 3 Lesson 18",
    "body": "Following the creation of initial survey questions in Round 4 of Unit 3 Lesson 18, teams share their proposed questions, and the class collectively decides on a maximum of 10 survey questions for their Participatory Sensing Campaign. A critical evaluation process then ensues for each selected survey question. Students must consider several key aspects: first, the type of data each question will collect (e.g., numerical, discrete numerical, text, categories, photos, location). This understanding is crucial for subsequent data analysis. Second, they assess how effectively each question contributes to addressing the overarching research question of the Participatory Sensing Campaign. Third, the clarity and understandability of the question are scrutinized; students determine if the question needs rephrasing to ensure respondents clearly understand what is being asked and how to answer it, mitigating potential question bias. If rewording is necessary, teams are assigned to revise the survey questions, with the final changes being decided as a class. The objective is to finalize precise, unbiased survey questions that directly correspond to the data variables needed, ensuring the integrity and utility of the data collected for the Participatory Sensing Campaign. This rigorous evaluation step is essential to developing a robust and ethically sound Participatory Sensing Campaign."

    "title": "Generating Statistical Questions (Round 5) and Initial Ethical Considerations in Unit 3 Lesson 18",
    "body": "In Round 5 of Unit 3 Lesson 18, the focus shifts from survey questions to the generation of statistical questions, which are central to the analytical phase of the Participatory Sensing Campaign. Working in teams, students are tasked with formulating two to three statistical questions that can be answered using the data collected through their newly designed survey questions. It is emphasized that these statistical questions must be both interesting and highly relevant to the class's chosen topic of interest for the Participatory Sensing Campaign. Students are reminded to record these questions in their DS Journals and to consider that their data will also include valuable metadata such as the date, time, and place of data collection. Examples of relevant statistical questions for a campaign tracking cello practice might include: 'How frequently do I practice?', 'When I practice more frequently, do I rate my sessions higher?', or 'Are higher-rated sessions associated with the time of day?'. After teams generate their statistical questions, they share them with the class. This step involves a crucial confirmation that the proposed questions are indeed statistical in nature and, importantly, that they can be directly addressed and answered using the specific types of data students propose to collect. This ensures alignment between the data collection strategy and the analytical goals of the Participatory Sensing Campaign, setting the stage for a meaningful and ethically sound Participatory Sensing Campaign."

    "title": "Comprehensive Evaluation of the Participatory Sensing Campaign in Unit 3 Lesson 18",
    "body": "Once all components of the Participatory Sensing Campaign, including survey and statistical questions, have been developed in Unit 3 Lesson 18, a comprehensive whole-group discussion is initiated to evaluate its overall reasonableness and ethical soundness. This critical evaluation phase is paramount to the success of any Participatory Sensing Campaign. Key questions addressed during this discussion include: 'Are answers to your survey questions likely to vary when the trigger occurs?' (to prevent boredom from repetitive data entry); 'Can the entire class effectively carry out the campaign?' (ensuring collective feasibility); 'Do triggers occur so rarely that you'll gather very little data, or so often that data entry becomes frustrating?' (optimizing data volume and participant engagement). A significant ethical component involves asking: 'Would sharing these data with strangers or friends be embarrassing or undermine someone's privacy?' This directly addresses the ethical considerations inherent in a Participatory Sensing Campaign. Further evaluative questions prompt reflection on whether the trigger or survey questions can be modified to improve the campaign's design and, crucially, 'Will you be able to gather enough relevant data from your survey questions to be able to answer your statistical questions?' This final check ensures that the campaign's data collection strategy aligns with its analytical objectives. By collaboratively addressing these points, students gain a deep understanding of what constitutes a robust, feasible, and ethically responsible Participatory Sensing Campaign, fulfilling the lesson's objective of evaluating their own Participatory Sensing Campaign."

    "title": "Finalizing the Participatory Sensing Campaign and Introduction to Tools in Unit 3 Lesson 18",
    "body": "Having navigated through the rigorous process of designing and evaluating their Participatory Sensing Campaign, students in Unit 3 Lesson 18 reach a significant milestone: the collaborative creation of their first complete Participatory Sensing Campaign. This achievement underscores the lesson's objective of not only developing statistical questions but also thoroughly evaluating the campaign's structure and ethics. The instructor then informs the students that they will be introduced to a specific tool commonly used to build such campaigns, similar to those found on smart devices or computers. This demonstration provides a practical bridge between the theoretical design and the actual implementation of a Participatory Sensing Campaign. Students are instructed to take detailed notes in their DS journals during this demonstration, as they will be required to utilize this tool themselves in subsequent activities. This step reinforces the practical application of the concepts learned throughout the lesson, preparing students for the real-world deployment of a Participatory Sensing Campaign. The lesson concludes with 'Class Scribes' – a designated team of students tasked with delivering a brief summary of what they consider to be the three most important topics covered during the day, further consolidating the learning experience regarding the evaluation and design of a Participatory Sensing Campaign."
