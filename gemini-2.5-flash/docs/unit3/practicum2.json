    "title": "Practicum Overview: Designing a Non-Leading Survey",
    "body": "This practicum, titled \"Let's Build a Survey!\", is an essential component of Unit 3, building upon concepts introduced in Unit 3 Lesson 9 through Unit 3 Lesson 14. Its primary objective is to guide students in designing a comprehensive survey that utilizes non-leading questions to gather data effectively. Participants will work in teams to select a research topic from a provided list or an alternative area of interest. Key tasks include formulating a research question and a related statistical question, defining the target population, outlining a sampling strategy to ensure generalizability, and determining the sample size. Furthermore, teams must create five non-leading survey questions, provide justification for their design, and identify a relevant statistic and a parameter for data analysis. The culmination of this practicum is the submission of a typed paper detailing the entire survey design process. Required materials for this activity include the \"LMR_U3_Practicum_Build_a_Survey\" document."

    "title": "Unit 3 Practicum: Objectives and Foundational Learning for Survey Design",
    "body": "The \"Practicum: Let’s Build a Survey!\" is a core activity within Unit 3, specifically designed to reinforce and apply knowledge gained from Unit 3 Lesson 9 through Unit 3 Lesson 14. The central objective for students engaging in this practicum is to develop a survey featuring non-leading questions. This task directly utilizes the theoretical understanding of survey construction, question formulation, and data collection principles covered in the preceding lessons. To facilitate this, students will refer to the official practicum document: \"LMR_U3_Practicum_Build_a_Survey\", which can be found in the IDS Curriculum v5.0 materials under \"2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 3_v_6.0/\". By applying the learned concepts, teams will demonstrate their ability to translate theoretical knowledge into a practical survey instrument capable of yielding unbiased data."

    "title": "Initiating Survey Design: Topic Selection and Research Question Formulation",
    "body": "As part of the \"Practicum: Let’s Build a Survey!\", teams are tasked with the initial crucial steps of survey development. The first step involves selecting a relevant topic of interest. Students can choose from a predefined list, which includes \"Social Media,\" \"Entertainment,\" \"Sports,\" \"The Environment,\" \"Health,\" and \"Education,\" or propose an \"Other topic of interest.\" Following topic selection, teams must formulate a clear research question that guides their investigation. This research question serves as the overarching inquiry. Subsequently, a specific statistical question must be created, directly related to the research question, which the survey aims to answer through quantitative data collection. These foundational steps ensure the survey has a focused objective and a clear direction for data gathering, building on the principles discussed in Unit 3 Lesson 9 through Unit 3 Lesson 14."

    "title": "Defining Population, Sampling Strategy, and Crafting Non-Leading Survey Items",
    "body": "Continuing with the \"Practicum: Let’s Build a Survey!\", after establishing the research and statistical questions, teams must meticulously define the target audience. This involves identifying the specific population of interest for their study. A critical component of the practicum is to describe a robust method for selecting a sample from this identified population. The chosen sampling method must be designed to enable valid generalizations about the larger population, a concept emphasized in Unit 3 Lesson 9 through Unit 3 Lesson 14. Teams also need to specify the exact number of individuals who will constitute their sample. A key requirement is the creation of five distinct survey questions, with a paramount focus on ensuring they are non-leading. Furthermore, teams must explicitly describe the measures taken to guarantee the non-leading nature of these questions, directly addressing the core objective of the practicum."

    "title": "Summarizing Survey Responses, Identifying Parameters, and Final Documentation",
    "body": "The \"Practicum: Let’s Build a Survey!\" extends beyond question design to encompass preliminary data analysis considerations. After developing the survey questions, teams are required to identify a statistic that would be appropriate for summarizing the anticipated responses from their survey. This step reinforces the understanding of how collected data can be quantified and interpreted. Additionally, students must attempt to identify a corresponding parameter related to their statistical question and population of interest, drawing on concepts from Unit 3 Lesson 9 through Unit 3 Lesson 14. The culmination of this comprehensive survey design process is the submission of a typed paper. This paper must thoroughly detail every aspect of the survey created, from topic selection and question formulation to sampling methods and analytical considerations, ensuring all specified requirements of the practicum are addressed."

    "title": "Comprehensive Task Overview: Topic Selection to Statistical Question Formulation",
    "body": "This practicum, \"Let’s Build a Survey!\", comprehensively guides students through key stages of survey development. Teams are first presented with a structured choice for their survey's focus, allowing them to select from predefined categories such as \"Social Media,\" \"Entertainment,\" \"Sports,\" \"The Environment,\" \"Health,\" \"Education,\" or to propose an \"Other topic of interest.\" Once a topic is established, the team's next critical task is to articulate a precise research question. This foundational question then leads to the creation of a statistical question, which must be directly related to the research question and designed to be answerable through the survey data. These initial steps, which draw heavily on the principles covered in Unit 3 Lesson 9 through Unit 3 Lesson 14, are crucial for setting the scope and analytical direction of the entire survey project, ensuring a logical flow from broad inquiry to specific, measurable questions."

    "title": "Defining the Target Audience: Population Identification and Sampling Strategies",
    "body": "A vital component of the \"Practicum: Let’s Build a Survey!\" requires teams to rigorously define their study's target. This involves clearly identifying the population of interest – the entire group to which the study's findings are intended to apply. Following this, teams must elaborate on the methodology they will employ to select their sample from this defined population. The description of the sampling process is paramount, as it must clearly explain how the chosen method will allow for valid generalizations to be made about the broader population of interest. This emphasis on generalizability is a direct application of the statistical concepts introduced in Unit 3 Lesson 9 through Unit 3 Lesson 14. Furthermore, teams must specify the exact number of individuals intended to be included in their sample, providing a concrete scope for their data collection efforts."

    "title": "Crafting Unbiased Survey Questions and Initial Data Summarization",
    "body": "In the \"Practicum: Let’s Build a Survey!\", a critical phase involves the development of the actual survey instrument. Teams are required to create five distinct survey questions that are specifically designed to address their previously formulated statistical question. A core instructional objective, reinforced from Unit 3 Lesson 9 through Unit 3 Lesson 14, is the absolute necessity of ensuring these questions are non-leading. Consequently, teams must provide a detailed explanation of the steps taken to prevent bias and ensure the neutrality of each question. Beyond question design, the practicum also introduces foundational analytical thinking, requiring students to identify a suitable statistic for summarizing the responses gathered from their survey and, where applicable, to identify a corresponding parameter, thus connecting sample data back to the broader population."
