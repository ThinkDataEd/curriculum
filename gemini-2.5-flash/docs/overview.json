    "title": "Abstract: Introduction to Data Science Curriculum",
    "body": "The Introduction to Data Science (IDS) curriculum provides a hands-on, project-based learning experience, introducing high school students to data analysis, computing, and mathematics. Developed in partnership with the Los Angeles Unified School District for a diverse student population, IDS deviates from traditional statistics by employing algorithmic statistical inference using modern randomization and simulation techniques. The course emphasizes practical applications, engaging students with 'Big Data' and fostering critical thinking about data-based arguments. Its instructional philosophy is rooted in Project-Based Learning (PBL) and the BSCS 5-E Instructional Model, guiding students through inquiry-based investigations. A central component is Participatory Sensing, where students collect their own data, cycling through asking questions, collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data (the Data Cycle). Students develop computational and statistical thinking skills using RStudio Cloud and the IDS ThinkData Ed app. The curriculum aligns with Common Core State Standards (CCSS-M), Standards for Mathematical Practice (SMP), CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards, and Applied Computational Thinking Standards (ACT). Key instructional topics include interpreting categorical and quantitative data, making inferences and justifying conclusions, understanding probability, and applying algebra in RStudio. Prerequisites include successful completion of a first-year Algebra course. The course prioritizes in-class computer-based assignments, student team collaboration, and open-ended classroom discussions, moving beyond drill-based learning to support claims with evidence and engage in data-based discourse."

    "title": "IDS Curriculum Goals and Pedagogical Approach",
    "body": "The Introduction to Data Science (IDS) curriculum aims to introduce students to the opportunities at the intersection of data analysis, computing, and mathematics through practical, hands-on activities. A core goal is to prepare students to navigate a data-rich world by focusing on real-world applications of data analysis, rather than small, curated datasets typical of traditional statistics courses. IDS engages students with 'Big Data' paradigms and uses algorithmic statistical inference, relying on modern randomization and simulation techniques instead of formula-based approaches. This empowers students to find meaning in data, communicate their findings effectively, and critically evaluate data-driven arguments. The curriculum was specifically developed for a culturally, linguistically, and socially diverse student body within the Los Angeles Unified School District, reflecting a commitment to broad accessibility and relevance. The instructional philosophy centers on Project-Based Learning (PBL), engaging students as active problem-solvers tackling ill-structured problems that mirror real-world challenges. This approach develops both problem-solving strategies and disciplinary knowledge through inquiry and culminating projects."

    "title": "Data-Driven Learning and Critical Thinking in IDS",
    "body": "The Introduction to Data Science (IDS) curriculum is designed to cultivate a 'data habit of mind' in students, encouraging them to seek data to answer questions and to critically evaluate claims. Instead of traditional formula-based statistical methods, IDS employs modern randomization and simulation techniques for algorithmic statistical inference, offering a practical and accessible introduction to data science. Students engage with a wide world of 'Big Data' that is relevant to their lives, moving beyond small, curated datasets. A key objective is to teach students to interpret data analyses and communicate their findings effectively, alongside developing critical thinking skills about arguments based on data. The curriculum supports students in applying scientific concepts, making decisions, and drawing conclusions from evidence. Through this rigorous yet accessible approach, IDS prepares students to not only analyze data but also to critically 'read' and assess existing data stories, discerning robust conclusions from flawed ones by compiling evidence and examining datasets hands-on. This iterative, inquiry-based process fosters an investigatory mindset, often framed as hypothesis evaluation or generation, ultimately teaching students to think like data scientists."

    "title": "Target Audience and Curriculum Standards",
    "body": "The Introduction to Data Science (IDS) curriculum was developed in collaboration with the Los Angeles Unified School District, specifically tailored for a culturally, linguistically, and socially diverse student population. This includes a significant percentage of English-language learners (over 38%, primarily Spanish speakers) and students qualifying for free or reduced lunches (74%). The curriculum's design ensures accessibility while providing a rigorous introduction to data science and statistics, requiring only a successful completion of a first-year Algebra course as a prerequisite, with no prior statistics or computer science experience necessary. The standards underpinning the IDS curriculum are primarily based on the High School Probability and Statistics Mathematics Common Core State Standards (CCSS-M), which also incorporate the Standards for Mathematical Practice (SMP). Additionally, the Computer Science Teacher’s Association (CSTA) K-12 Computer Science Standards were consulted and integrated. The Applied Computational Thinking Standards (ACT) further delineate how data science concepts are applied using technology within the course, ensuring a comprehensive foundation in both mathematical and computational competencies for all students."

    "title": "Instructional Philosophy: Project-Based Learning and 5-E Model",
    "body": "The Introduction to Data Science (IDS) curriculum adopts a Project-Based Learning (PBL) approach, which Finkle and Torp (1955) define as a system that simultaneously develops problem-solving strategies and disciplinary knowledge through active student engagement with ill-structured, real-world problems. PBL focuses on core concepts, involves students in problem-solving investigations, encourages knowledge construction through inquiry, and culminates in a project. Complementing PBL, IDS also utilizes the BSCS 5-E Instructional Model, a planned sequence of instruction that places students at the center of their learning. The 5-E Model stages — Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate — guide students through an inquiry process. In the 'Engage' stage, students develop curiosity and connect to prior knowledge; 'Explore' encourages collaborative work and hypothesis testing; 'Explain' involves students articulating their ideas and listening critically to others; 'Elaborate' applies new concepts in similar situations; and 'Evaluate' assesses understanding and fosters self-reflection. This model encourages students to create their own meaning of concepts and relate their understanding to other ideas, forming the basis for the lessons within the IDS units."

    "title": "Hardware and Software Requirements for IDS",
    "body": "For optimal implementation of the Introduction to Data Science (IDS) curriculum, an ideal laboratory environment supports a 1:1 computer to student ratio. These computers can be Apple, PC, or Chromebook models, ensuring flexibility based on available resources. Internet access is a mandatory requirement, as it facilitates the use of RStudio on an external server, specifically through the RStudio Cloud platform (posit.cloud). Instructors must also have access to a computer and a projector for daily teaching activities. Tablets are not recommended for student use. Each classroom computer should have a modern, updated web browser like Firefox or Google Chrome to access RStudio Cloud, conduct searches, and utilize various online tools. The IDS curriculum's specialized software, including the IDS ThinkData Ed app, is provided by the IDS team and accessible via the IDS home page (portal.thinkdataed.org). This app is available for Android and iOS smartphones/tablets, as well as through web browsers on desktops or laptops, enabling students to collect Participatory Sensing data, which serves as a motivational cornerstone for the course."

    "title": "Developing Computational and Statistical Thinking",
    "body": "The Introduction to Data Science (IDS) curriculum is meticulously designed to cultivate both computational and statistical thinking skills in students. Computationally, students learn to write code for data analysis, break down complex problems into manageable parts, and understand and implement algorithms for problem-solving. This is primarily facilitated through the use of RStudio. Statistically, the curriculum fosters a 'data habit of mind,' encouraging students to actively seek data to answer questions or evaluate claims. It emphasizes critical thinking regarding the suitability of data to support specific claims, teaches students how to interpret data analyses, and develops their ability to effectively communicate findings. A core pedagogical element is Participatory Sensing, which grants students control over the data collection process, enabling them to gather data on topics important to them. The curriculum is structured around a series of Participatory Sensing 'campaigns,' wherein students repeatedly engage in the Data Cycle: asking questions, examining and collecting data, analyzing data, and interpreting data, iteratively deepening their understanding. Initially, analysis is descriptive, evolving later to use randomization-based algorithms and simulations for inference, promoting critical evaluation of the data collection process. This iterative engagement across varied contexts, including student-designed campaigns, helps students develop a data scientist's mindset."

    "title": "The Data Cycle and Iterative Learning in IDS",
    "body": "A fundamental concept in the Introduction to Data Science (IDS) curriculum is the Data Cycle, an iterative process that guides students through all stages of statistical inquiry. This cycle involves: 1) asking questions, 2) examining and collecting data, 3) analyzing data, and 4) interpreting data. The curriculum is organized around Participatory Sensing 'campaigns' that provide a motivational foundation by allowing students to collect data on subjects relevant to their lives, giving them control over the data collection process. As students advance through the IDS curriculum, they engage with the Data Cycle in increasingly sophisticated ways. Initially, data analysis and interpretation are purely descriptive. Later, the curriculum introduces randomization-based algorithms and simulations to develop concepts of statistical inference, encouraging students to become more critical of data collection methods. By repeatedly engaging in the Data Cycle within various contexts, including designing their own data collection campaigns, students progressively develop the holistic thinking process characteristic of data scientists. This iterative approach reinforces learning and deepens understanding of how data can be used to answer questions and inform conclusions."

    "title": "Classroom Dynamics: Collaboration, Discussion, and Assignments",
    "body": "The Introduction to Data Science (IDS) curriculum places significant emphasis on active classroom dynamics, including student team collaboration, open discussions, and inquiry-based assignments. Many activities are designed for pairs or teams, with an ideal team size of four students. Establishing teams and defining roles early in the course is imperative, with clear expectations for teamwork introduced promptly. Teacher resources provide instructional strategies and team roles to facilitate effective collaboration, and instructors are encouraged to model these strategies if students are unfamiliar. As an inquiry-based curriculum, classroom discussion is crucial; norms should be set early to encourage all students to contribute in a non-judgmental, open environment. The curriculum acknowledges that most questions will have multiple valid answers, fostering an environment where students support claims with evidence. Teachers are encouraged to ensure all voices are heard, inviting participation from quieter students and guiding more vocal ones to encourage their peers. Most IDS work, especially computer-based assignments, takes place in the classroom to ensure equitable access to technology. Lessons are designed for 50-60 minute periods, and while open-ended assignments may be sent home, computer-dependent tasks are in-class. Students are expected to maintain a Data Science (DS) journal for notes and small assignments, and End of Unit Projects, oral presentations, and Practicums serve as application exercises with provided scoring guides. Drill-based assignments are avoided in favor of inquiry and data-based discussions."

    "title": "Assessment and Homework Practices in IDS",
    "body": "In the Introduction to Data Science (IDS) curriculum, assessment and homework practices are aligned with its inquiry-based instructional model, moving away from traditional drill-based assignments. Most questions in the class are open-ended, encouraging students to support their claims with evidence and engage in data-based discussions, often referencing newspaper, periodical, or digital articles provided via links in the lessons. Computer-based assignments are primarily completed in class to ensure all students have access to the necessary hardware and software, avoiding the assumption of home computer availability. The exception is for students who miss Unit X Lab Z time, in which case they must complete the assignment outside of class using any Internet-enabled computer (e.g., at school or a public library). Students will typically complete one RStudio lab assignment per week, with teachers having discretion over collecting them. Calculators are expected to be available daily. A crucial component for students is their Data Science (DS) journal, a notebook for notes, small assignments, and sketching plots, which teachers may choose to check for credit. End of Unit Projects, oral presentations, and Practicums are designed as application exercises, and scoring guides are provided to aid in setting student performance expectations, with teachers responsible for grading these comprehensive assessments."

    "title": "Core Instructional Topics: Interpreting Data",
    "body": "The Introduction to Data Science (IDS) curriculum outlines four major instructional components based on the Common Core State Standards High School - Statistics and Probability. The first category, 'I. Interpreting Categorical and Quantitative Data,' forms a foundational part of the course. This section introduces students to various types of data and how to derive meaning from them. Key topics include numerical and graphical summaries such as measures of center and spread, boxplots, bar plots, histograms, and scatterplots, as well as graphical summaries for multivariate data. The curriculum emphasizes that data interpretation is rarely 'standard,' encouraging students to construct multiple views of data to uncover underlying stories. It expands beyond numerical data to consider time, location, text, and image as data types. Simulation is introduced as a critical tool for visual inference and calibrating interpretations, helping students understand what 'story-less' data or pure noise looks like. Students also engage in a modeling practice, fitting and evaluating standard mathematical and statistical models like least-squares regression lines, and designing probabilistic simulations to test hypothetical chance processes against real-world data. These skills prepare students to explain and describe real-world phenomena using statistical analyses."

    "title": "Core Instructional Topics: Making Inferences and Justifying Conclusions",
    "body": "The second major instructional component of the Introduction to Data Science (IDS) curriculum focuses on 'II. Making Inferences and Justifying Conclusions,' addressing the increasing abundance and interoperability of data in the Post-Web 2.0 era. This section begins by teaching students to critically evaluate data sources and their mechanics, asking questions about trust, comparison between organizations, and previously told stories. Students learn to critique published data stories and visualizations, and to formulate their own questions, identify datasets, and evaluate new findings against existing narratives. The course delves into data with special structures, such as those generated by random sampling (e.g., polls) or random assignment (e.g., clinical trials and A/B testing). Here, simulation-based inference takes on new significance, allowing students to assess uncertainty, assign margins of error, and identify statistically significant effects. For data without such formal origins (e.g., convenience samples), a mix of simulation and subsetting techniques is applied for storytelling. A key practical element is Participatory Sensing, where students design data collection campaigns to formalize questions and augment or challenge existing data sources. This entire process relies heavily on computation in RStudio, teaching students simple programming tools to access data, create views, fit models, and assess their importance via simulation, making computation a medium for learning about data and telling elaborate data stories."

    "title": "Core Instructional Topics: Probability and Computation in RStudio",
    "body": "The Introduction to Data Science (IDS) curriculum integrates 'III. Probability' and 'IV. Algebra in RStudio' as essential components for developing a deep understanding of statistical concepts. Since simulation is the primary tool for reasoning with data, understanding basic probability rules is crucial for interpreting simulation outputs. Students explore how computers generate random phenomena (e.g., pseudo-random numbers, web services) and use simple probability calculations to predict outcomes, comparing these to simulation results. This approach formally ties simulation to theoretical probability, especially motivating the relationship between frequency and probability through independent trials. Students learn that as the number of simulations increases, the frequency of an event tends towards its probability (the Law of Large Numbers). This foundational understanding then supports simulating various random processes for formal statistical inference, particularly when random mechanisms were part of the data design (e.g., in Unit X Campaign Y or Unit X Lab Z). Probability thus becomes a 'ruler' for assessing the importance of data stories. The 'Algebra in RStudio' section provides the computational backbone, teaching students practical programming skills including working with vectors, understanding algorithms, writing functions, evaluating and fitting models to data, creating graphical representations of multivariate data, and generating numerical summaries of distributions, all interpreted within relevant contexts. These computational tools are integral for students to apply the statistical and probabilistic concepts learned throughout the course."

    "title": "Interpreting Data: Summaries, Graphics, and Modeling Techniques",
    "body": "The IDS curriculum unit on 'Interpreting Categorical and Quantitative Data' delves into a range of techniques for understanding and presenting datasets. Students learn to create standard numerical and graphical summaries, including measures of center and spread, boxplots for visualizing distributions, bar plots for categorical data, histograms for numerical distributions, and scatterplots for examining relationships between two quantitative variables. The course also covers graphical summaries specifically designed for multivariate data. Critically, IDS extends beyond typical numerical data to consider time, location, text, and even image data types, exploring how different 'views' can uncover patterns or stories. A key innovation is the use of simulation for 'visual inference,' which helps students calibrate their interpretations by understanding what 'story-less' data (i.e., pure noise) looks like. Students engage in a robust modeling practice, aligned with CCSS mathematical practices, to explain and describe real-world phenomena. This includes fitting and evaluating standard mathematical and statistical models, notably the least-squares regression line. Furthermore, students design and implement probabilistic simulations to test and compare hypothetical chance processes against observed real-world data, strengthening their analytical and predictive capabilities."

    "title": "Justifying Conclusions: Data Sources, Inference, and Participatory Sensing",
    "body": "The IDS curriculum section on 'Making Inferences and Justifying Conclusions' equips students with the skills to critically evaluate data and draw sound conclusions. It addresses the challenge of abundant data by focusing on aggregating data, including identifying trustworthy sources, understanding the 'mechanics' of Web 2.0 data flow, and comparing data from different organizations. Students learn to critique existing published data stories and visualizations and to formulate their own research questions, identify relevant datasets, and assess new findings against old ones. The course places special emphasis on data generated through random processes, such as random sampling (e.g., in surveys or polls) and random assignment (e.g., in clinical trials or A/B testing). For such data, simulation-based inference is used to assess uncertainty, calculate margins of error for poll results, or determine if new treatments have a 'significant' effect. When data lacks this formal random origin (e.g., 'samples of convenience'), the curriculum provides techniques using a mix of simulation and subsetting for storytelling. A unique and empowering aspect is the introduction of Participatory Sensing as a data collection strategy. Students learn to design their own Unit X Campaign Y, formalizing questions, informed by research and existing data analysis, to build upon, augment, or challenge current sources, thereby making the 'culture' behind data sources a part of classroom discussion and critical inquiry."
