    "title": "Unit 2 Lab 2A: Basic Statistical Measures and Data Summaries",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lab 2A is designed to teach students how to utilize R for answering fundamental statistical questions, specifically those addressable by calculating the mean, median, and mean absolute deviation (MAD). Through this lab, students will gain practical experience in computing these core descriptive statistics to summarize data distributions. The new R functions introduced in Unit 2 Lab 2A to facilitate these calculations include: `mean(~x, data)` for computing the arithmetic mean of a variable `x` within a specified dataset, `median(~x, data)` for finding the median, `add_line(vline)` potentially for adding visual reference lines to plots, and `MAD(~x, data)` for calculating the mean absolute deviation, providing a robust measure of statistical dispersion. These functions enable students to quickly grasp central tendency and variability in their data."

    "title": "Unit 2 Lab 2C: Simulating Random Events and Controlling Reproducibility",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lab 2C focuses on the crucial statistical concept of simulation within the R environment. Students will learn how to simulate a playlist, creating a sequence of items using the `rep()` function. A core skill developed in this lab is randomly choosing a song or element from such a playlist, accomplished with the `sample()` function, allowing for controlled sampling with or without replacement. Furthermore, the lab teaches how to execute multiple repetitions of a random process efficiently using the `do()` function, which is fundamental for understanding variability and conducting Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, Unit 2 Lab 2C emphasizes the importance of reproducibility in random processes by introducing `set.seed()`, a function that allows users to generate the exact same sequence of random events, ensuring consistency in analysis. The key R functions are: `rep(x, times)` for repeating elements, `sample(x, size, replace)` for random selection, `do(x)` for repetitions, and `set.seed(x)` for reproducibility."

    "title": "Unit 2 Lab 2D: Calculating Probabilities of Complex Events with mutate() and rowSums()",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lab 2D guides students through the process of calculating probabilities for more complex events using advanced data manipulation techniques in R. The primary objective is to enable students to effectively use the `mutate()` function, often in conjunction with other functions, to create new variables or transform existing ones within a dataset, thereby preparing data for probability calculations. A key function introduced in Unit 2 Lab 2D is `rowSums(x)`, which is essential for summing values across rows, particularly useful when aggregating outcomes of multiple trials or events. Additionally, the standard division operator (`/`) is highlighted as crucial for converting counts or sums into probabilities. By combining `mutate()` and `rowSums()`, students will learn to derive probabilities for scenarios that involve multiple conditions or outcomes, moving beyond simple event probabilities to more sophisticated probabilistic modeling."

    "title": "Unit 2 Labs 2E and 2F: Utilizing Permutation for Chance and Significance",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lab 2E and Unit 2 Lab 2F both delve into the powerful technique of using permuted data to assess the likelihood of an observed event occurring purely by chance, or to determine the statistical significance of a numerical summary. In Unit 2 Lab 2E, students investigate a specific question: \"Are women in slasher films more likely to survive until the end of the film than men?\" This lab employs permutation methods to simulate scenarios where gender has no effect on survival, allowing students to compare the actual observed survival rates against these chance outcomes. Similarly, Unit 2 Lab 2F explores the question: \"Is there any evidence to suggest that those who survived paid a higher fare than those who died on the Titanic?\" Here, permuted data is used to gauge whether differences in numerical summaries, such as fare, are significant or could have arisen randomly. Notably, neither Unit 2 Lab 2E nor Unit 2 Lab 2F introduce any new R functions; instead, they focus on applying previously learned functions within the context of permutation testing to draw robust statistical conclusions."

    "title": "Unit 2 Lab 2G: Merging Multiple Datasets for Comprehensive Analysis",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lab 2G focuses on a critical skill in data science: combining information from disparate sources. The primary objective of Unit 2 Lab 2G is to teach students how to use the `merge()` function in R to integrate data from multiple datasets. This is essential for conducting more comprehensive analyses that require variables spread across different files or tables. For instance, the lab investigates the question: \"How do peopleâ€™s personality colors and/or sports participation affect their stress levels?\" To answer such a complex question, data on personality, sports, and stress levels, potentially residing in separate datasets, must first be brought together. The new R function central to this process is `merge(x, y, by)`, where `x` and `y` are the datasets to be combined, and `by` specifies the common column(s) used for matching rows, ensuring an accurate and meaningful integration of data."

    "title": "Unit 2 Lab 2H: Understanding Normal Curve Shape and Model Appropriateness",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lab 2H is dedicated to exploring the properties of the normal distribution, a cornerstone in statistics. The main objective is for students to understand how changes in the mean and standard deviation parameters directly impact the shape and spread of a normal curve. Through interactive exercises, students will recognize that the mean dictates the curve's center, while the standard deviation determines its width. Furthermore, Unit 2 Lab 2H aims to develop students' ability to recognize when a normal model is an appropriate fit for real-world data, a crucial step before applying normal distribution-based statistical tests. The new R functions introduced to visualize and assess normal distributions are: `plotDist('norm', mean, sd)` for plotting a theoretical normal distribution with specified mean and standard deviation, and `histogram(x, fit = \"normal\")` for creating a histogram of observed data overlaid with a fitted normal curve, allowing for visual comparison."

    "title": "Unit 2 Lab 2I: Calculating Probabilities, Quantiles, and Simulating from Normal Distributions",
    "body": "Unit 2 Lab 2I provides students with the tools to work extensively with the normal distribution, moving beyond visual understanding to quantitative calculations and simulations. The objectives include using the `pnorm()` function to calculate cumulative probabilities from a normal distribution, determining the probability of observing a value less than or equal to a given quantile. Students will also learn to simulate random draws from a normal distribution using `rnorm()`, which is invaluable for Monte Carlo simulations and understanding sampling variability. Furthermore, Unit 2 Lab 2I covers the `qnorm()` function, enabling students to calculate quantiles from a normal distribution, effectively finding the value below which a specified probability falls. These three functions are essential for applying the normal model in various statistical contexts. The new R functions are: `pnorm(q, mean, sd)` for probabilities, `rnorm(n, mean, sd)` for random numbers, and `qnorm(p, mean, sd)` for quantiles."

    "title": "Unit 2: Applying Permutation Tests for Statistical Significance (Labs 2E & 2F)",
    "body": "Unit 2 includes dedicated labs, Unit 2 Lab 2E and Unit 2 Lab 2F, which emphasize the application of permuted data to evaluate the role of chance in observed outcomes and to gauge statistical significance. In Unit 2 Lab 2E, students are tasked with investigating whether women in slasher films exhibit a higher survival rate than men, utilizing permutation to determine if any observed difference is beyond random chance. Similarly, Unit 2 Lab 2F challenges students to analyze Titanic data, asking if survivors paid a significantly higher fare than those who perished, again employing permutation to assess the statistical significance of numerical summaries like mean fare. These labs are crucial for understanding hypothesis testing without relying on new R functions, instead leveraging previously acquired knowledge to perform robust data analysis. Both labs reinforce the concept that observed patterns need to be tested against a null hypothesis of random chance."
