    "title": "Abstract: Unit 4 Lesson 4 Campaign Evaluation and Implementation",
    "body": "Unit 4 Lesson 4 focuses on guiding students through the final stages of designing a community-focused Participatory Sensing campaign and evaluating its feasibility through a mock implementation. The lesson emphasizes that statistical questions are crucial for learning about a community or oneself, and that campaigns must be thoroughly evaluated for reasonableness and ethical soundness prior to full implementation. Students refine research questions, brainstorm data types and triggers, develop and critically evaluate survey questions for clarity and bias using the *Team Campaign Creation* handout (LMR_U4_L2), and formulate up to three guiding statistical questions. A significant part of the lesson involves a comprehensive discussion on the campaign's feasibility, including data variation, team capacity, trigger frequency, and critical ethical considerations like privacy. The lesson culminates in the collaborative creation of a refined campaign, followed by a homework assignment to mock implement the campaign and collect initial data."

    "title": "Unit 4 Lesson 4: Designing and Evaluating Participatory Sensing Campaigns",
    "body": "The primary objective of Unit 4 Lesson 4 is for students to complete the detailed design of their community-focused Participatory Sensing campaign. Following the design phase, students are tasked with implementing a mock version of their campaign. This mock implementation serves as a crucial evaluation step, allowing teams to assess the overall feasibility of their proposed campaign. A core essential concept highlighted in this lesson is that Participatory Sensing campaigns, guided by well-defined statistical questions, enable us to gain insights into a community or ourselves. Furthermore, it is stressed that all such campaigns require rigorous evaluation for both reasonableness and ethical soundness before they are put into full effect. Students utilize the *Team Campaign Creation* handout (LMR_U4_L2) as a primary material throughout this design and evaluation process."

    "title": "Unit 4 Lesson 4: Research Question Refinement and Data Trigger Identification",
    "body": "In Unit 4 Lesson 4, students begin by refining their Participatory Sensing campaign by reviewing and finalizing their team research question. This foundational step ensures that all subsequent design elements align with a clear inquiry. Following the establishment of a research question, student teams engage in 'Round 3' of the design process. During this phase, they brainstorm and discuss the specific types of data that need to be collected to effectively answer their research question. Concurrently, they determine the optimal timing for triggering data collection or survey completion events. The guiding principle for this brainstorming is to identify data and triggers that will yield information directly addressing their chosen research question, laying the groundwork for developing relevant survey questions."

    "title": "Unit 4 Lesson 4: Crafting and Evaluating Survey Questions for Participatory Sensing Campaigns",
    "body": "Unit 4 Lesson 4 guides students through the critical process of creating and evaluating survey questions for their Participatory Sensing campaigns. After determining data types and triggers in 'Round 3,' teams proceed to 'Round 4' where they design survey questions or prompts tailored to collect the identified data when a trigger is set. These questions must be comprehensive, considering all possible data that might be collected during the trigger event. A crucial evaluation phase follows, where each question is assessed for its type (e.g., number, text, photo, time, single choice), its direct relevance to the research question, and its clarity. Rewording questions for better understanding, possibly through peer review, is encouraged. Finalized, unbiased survey questions and prompts are then recorded on the *Team Campaign Creation* handout (LMR_U4_L2), ensuring they align with data variables."

    "title": "Unit 4 Lesson 4: Formulating Statistical Questions for Campaign Guidance",
    "body": "A key component of Unit 4 Lesson 4 is 'Round 5,' where student teams generate the statistical questions that will guide their Participatory Sensing campaign. Students are tasked with creating up to three statistical questions that are not only interesting and relevant to their chosen topic but can also be directly answered by the data they propose to collect. The lesson reminds students that in addition to their planned survey data, they will automatically have access to data regarding the date, time, and geographical location of data collection, which can inform their statistical questions. Teachers circulate to confirm that these questions are indeed statistical in nature and align with the campaign's data collection capabilities, reinforcing the essential concept that statistical questions drive the learning objectives of the campaign."

    "title": "Unit 4 Lesson 4: Comprehensive Feasibility and Ethical Review of Campaigns",
    "body": "In Unit 4 Lesson 4, a critical phase involves teams thoroughly evaluating the reasonableness and ethical soundness of their Participatory Sensing campaign. This discussion addresses several key questions: Is there likely to be variation in survey answers when the trigger occurs to avoid repetitive data entry? Can the team realistically carry out the campaign? Is the trigger frequency appropriate, avoiding both too little and overwhelming amounts of data? Ethically, would sharing collected data potentially cause embarrassment or undermine privacy for participants? Finally, teams consider if changes to triggers or survey questions are needed to improve the campaign's overall evaluation and ensure sufficient relevant data for answering statistical questions. This rigorous review is central to the lesson's objective of implementing a feasible and ethically sound campaign."

    "title": "Unit 4 Lesson 4: Adjustments, Mock Implementation, and Ethical Review",
    "body": "Unit 4 Lesson 4 emphasizes an iterative design process, particularly during the evaluation of campaign reasonableness and ethical soundness. Following a detailed discussion where teams consider factors such as data variation, team capacity, trigger frequency, and potential privacy concerns, they are empowered to make necessary adjustments to their Participatory Sensing campaign. This ensures that the finalized campaign is both practical and responsible. Once these adjustments are made, students will have collaboratively created their Team Participatory Sensing campaign, documented using the *Team Campaign Creation* handout (LMR_U4_L2). The lesson extends into homework, where students are assigned to mock implement their campaign to collect data, bridging the gap between design and practical application and further evaluating feasibility before a full-scale launch."

    "title": "Unit 4 Lesson 4: Campaign Finalization, Scribe Report, and Mock Data Collection",
    "body": "As Unit 4 Lesson 4 draws to a close, teams finalize their Participatory Sensing campaign after a comprehensive evaluation of its reasonableness and ethical implications, making any necessary design adjustments. This culminates in the collaborative creation of their complete team campaign. To reinforce key takeaways, one team of students acts as 'Class Scribes' to discuss the three most important topics covered during the day. The lesson's practical application is solidified through homework: students are tasked with mock implementing their Team Participatory Sensing campaign. This exercise involves collecting data in a simulated environment, allowing them to test the functionality and effectiveness of their chosen triggers and survey questions, thereby preparing for actual data collection and analysis to address their statistical questions."
