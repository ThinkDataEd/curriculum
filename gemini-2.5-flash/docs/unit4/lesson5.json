    "body": "Unit 4 Lesson 5 focuses on the iterative process of designing and creating Participatory Sensing campaigns. Students begin by discussing findings from a mock implementation of their community-focused campaigns, identifying areas for revision. This critical step ensures that the campaigns are designed to collect relevant and accurate data, guided by well-formulated statistical questions. Following revisions, student teams utilize a specialized Campaign Authoring tool, guided by the \"Campaign Authoring\" handout (LMR_U4_L5.pdf), to officially create their campaigns. A key aspect of this creation phase is adopting a naming convention, such as including team names or numbers, to distinguish their campaigns when viewed on smart devices or web browsers. The lesson culminates in students verifying their campaign's appearance and then planning for their End of Unit 4 Modeling Activity Project. The lesson also includes a 'Class Scribes' activity where one team summarizes key topics of the day. Homework involves initiating data collection for their newly created Team Participatory Sensing campaign, with data collection continuing until the end of Unit 4 to ensure a sufficient amount of information is gathered by team members. The overarching goal is for students to develop self-contained, data-driven campaigns that effectively explore community or personal insights."
