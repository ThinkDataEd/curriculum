    "title": "Abstract: Unit 4, Section 5: Ties that Bind – Data Classification with Clustering and Networks",
    "body": "Unit 4, Section 5, titled 'Ties that Bind,' is designed for 3 instructional days and focuses on data classification through clustering (specifically k-means) and network analysis. Students will explore how to group data based on numerical similarities and relationships. Key learning objectives include understanding the k-means algorithm, applying it using RStudio to find and plot data clusters, and comprehending network formation. The unit also covers the real-world applications of these techniques, such as the National Security Agency's use of network analysis to identify terrorist networks or k-means for grouping countries. Students will engage in activities like classifying data points (e.g., football players vs. swimmers) and utilizing data files such as `data(futbol)` and their own collected data from the Unit X Campaign 'TimeUse'. Language objectives emphasize explaining k-means, describing data differences, and justifying community recommendations through visualizations and summaries."

    "title": "Unit 4, Section 5: Enduring Understandings – Clustering with K-Means",
    "body": "In Unit 4, Section 5, 'Ties that Bind,' students will develop enduring understandings related to data classification. A primary concept is clustering, which serves as a method to categorize data into distinct groups. This process involves classifying observations primarily based on their numerical characteristics and inherent similarities. A key algorithm introduced is k-means. This algorithm is used to determine a mean value for each of 'k' clusters. Its operational procedure involves an initial random assignment of a mean value, followed by an iterative process where the mean is adjusted and moved based on its proximity to the data points, thereby forming optimized clusters. This foundational understanding equips students with a powerful tool for data organization."

    "title": "Unit 4, Section 5: Enduring Understandings – Network Classification",
    "body": "Unit 4, Section 5, 'Ties that Bind,' provides enduring understandings regarding network analysis as a method for data classification. Networks are employed to group individuals or entities based on their established relationships, specifically focusing on 'who knows whom.' Within this framework, a fundamental concept is the 'node.' Nodes are formed whenever a relationship or connection exists between two distinct people. This classification approach offers a unique perspective on organizing data, moving beyond purely numerical attributes to consider the structural connections and interactions within a dataset, complementing the clustering techniques also taught in this unit."

    "title": "Unit 4, Section 5: Applied Computational Thinking and Data Science Objectives",
    "body": "The learning objectives for Unit 4, Section 5, 'Ties that Bind,' emphasize both Data Science principles and Applied Computational Thinking using RStudio. Students are expected to gain a clear understanding of the internal processes of RStudio when it executes the `k-means` function to identify clusters within a dataset. Furthermore, they will learn how RStudio facilitates the creation of networks, aiding in the classification of data into meaningful groups. Practically, students will develop the skill to apply the `k-means` function within RStudio to effectively find clusters in a given set of data. They will also learn to visually represent their findings by plotting the data, clearly indicating the cluster assignments derived from the `k-means` function. These objectives combine theoretical understanding with hands-on application."

    "title": "Unit 4, Section 5: Statistical Objectives and Real-World Applications",
    "body": "Unit 4, Section 5, 'Ties that Bind,' incorporates significant statistical learning objectives alongside real-world applications of data classification. The statistical objective, S-IC 2, requires students to decide if a specified model is consistent with results from a given data-generating process, potentially using simulation. This unit highlights the practical relevance of its concepts: Network analysis is utilized by various entities, including the National Security Agency (NSA), to identify and strategically impact terrorist networks by understanding communication patterns. The k-means algorithm also has widespread applicability, for instance, in grouping entities like countries based on the similarity of their attributes, allowing for more fair and relevant comparisons between them. These examples underscore the high impact of data science in diverse fields."

    "title": "Unit 4, Section 5: Student Engagement and Language Objectives",
    "body": "For Unit 4, Section 5, 'Ties that Bind,' student engagement is designed around a practical activity where students will analyze a plot of points and determine how they should be grouped, such as classifying them as 'football players' or 'swimmers,' based on identified clustering characteristics. The unit also features specific language objectives to enhance communication skills. Students will be required to articulate, in their own words, an explanation of k-means clustering. They will also describe the differences observed between time spent on videogames and time spent on homework, using data collected from their own class for the Unit X Campaign 'TimeUse.' Finally, students will create visualizations and numerical summaries to orally and in writing explain and justify recommendations aimed at improving their community, fostering critical thinking and persuasive communication."

    "title": "Unit 4, Section 5: Data Files and Collection Methods",
    "body": "Unit 4, Section 5, 'Ties that Bind,' outlines specific data resources and collection methods for student activities. For pre-existing data, students will use two primary data files: 1. The 'USMNT and NFL' dataset, accessible via the command `data(futbol)`. 2. Data collected by students themselves from the Unit X Campaign 'TimeUse.' Complementing these files, a key data collection method is the 'Team-generated Participatory Sensing Campaign.' Through this method, students will actively engage in collecting their own data on a topic that their team selects, providing a hands-on experience with the data lifecycle from raw collection to subsequent analysis. This approach ensures students work with both provided and self-generated datasets."

    "title": "Unit 4, Section 5: K-Means Clustering - Redundancy and Application Details",
    "body": "In Unit 4, Section 5, 'Ties that Bind,' k-means clustering is a central topic for classifying data. This technique groups observations based on their numerical characteristics and similarities. Students learn to implement k-means using RStudio, understanding that the function helps find 'k' clusters. The algorithm works by initially assigning random mean values to clusters and then iteratively adjusting these means based on their proximity to data points until optimal groupings are formed. Practical skills include plotting data with cluster assignments. This method has significant real-world utility, such as dividing countries into similar groups for equitable comparisons, demonstrating its applicability in diverse analytical contexts."

    "body": "Unit 4, Section 5, 'Ties that Bind,' reinforces the concept of network analysis as a powerful data classification method. It classifies people into groupings based on their relationships – 'who knows whom' – where a relationship between two individuals forms a 'node.' The unit emphasizes the critical real-world applications of network analysis, notably by the National Security Agency (NSA). The NSA uses this technique to identify and analyze terrorist networks, with the goal of maximizing impact on their communications and operations. This illustrates how understanding relational structures can have profound implications for security and intelligence, providing a compelling example of data science in action."
