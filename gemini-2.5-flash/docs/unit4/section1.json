    "body": "Unit 4, Section 1, titled 'Campaigns and Community,' is designed for 5 instructional days, focusing on engaging students in statistical reasoning through modeling activities. Students will tackle complex, real-world problems, such as urban pollution, introduced through the video 'Fighting Pollution Through Data.' Key learning objectives include applying the California Common Core State Standards-Mathematics (CCSS-M) framework for modeling, utilizing mathematical practices like abstract reasoning and mathematical modeling, and applying data science conceptual understandings. Computationally, students will create Participatory Sensing campaigns using an Authoring Tool in RStudio. The unit emphasizes real-world connections, showing how professionals use modeling daily. Language objectives focus on constructing summary statements about data, engaging in discussions, and evaluating claims based on data. Students will work with the `data(trash)` file and collect their own data via team-generated Participatory Sensing Campaigns."
