    "title": "Abstract: Unit 4 Lesson 15 - Combining Variables for Improved Predictions",
    "body": "Unit 4 Lesson 15, titled 'Combination of Variables,' focuses on teaching students how to make more accurate predictions by incorporating multiple variables into a predictive model. The lesson's objective is to explore methods of combining information to enhance predictive capabilities, specifically within the context of advertising effectiveness on sales. Key activities include an initial discussion using 'Agree/Disagree' strategies on the impact of variable combination, brainstorming various advertising variable combinations, and then analyzing a multi-variable linear regression model. A central component is the evaluation of different models—single-variable versus combined-variable approaches—using Mean Squared Error (MSE). Students learn that a lower MSE signifies a better predictive model, identifying the TV-Radio model as the most reliable predictor in this lesson. The session also addresses the plausibility of predictions and revisits initial hypotheses about combining variables, concluding with an introduction to Unit 4 Lab 4F, where students will create multi-variable models, and a homework assignment on the limitations of visualizing high-dimensional data."

    "title": "Unit 4 Lesson 15: Objective to Enhance Predictions by Combining Variables",
    "body": "The primary objective of Unit 4 Lesson 15, 'Combination of Variables,' is for students to learn how to achieve more accurate predictions by integrating multiple variables into their analytical models. This lesson emphasizes the core statistical concept that if several predictors are relevant to a response variable, a predictive model incorporating these multiple variables will generally yield better results, as objectively measured by the Mean Squared Error (MSE). Students will engage in activities designed to help them understand not only *that* more variables can lead to better predictions but also *how* this information should be combined effectively. The lesson uses real-world examples, such as the impact of various advertising channels (TV, Radio, Newspaper) on sales, to illustrate these principles. This foundational understanding is critical for developing robust predictive models and is a key learning outcome for Unit 4 Lesson 15."

    "title": "Initial Activities in Unit 4 Lesson 15: Debating Variable Combination Impact",
    "body": "Unit 4 Lesson 15 begins by engaging students in a critical discussion about the impact of combining multiple predictor variables on model accuracy, building directly on concepts and materials from Unit 4 Lesson 14. Students are presented with the *Advertising Plots Part 2* handout (LMR_U4_L14_B) and two contrasting statements previously introduced in Unit 4 Lesson 14. One statement posits that combining variables leads to worse predictions due to contamination from poor predictors, while the other suggests it leads to better predictions by utilizing more information. Students use an 'Agree/Disagree' strategy to share their initial opinions. Following this, teams brainstorm and list various combinations of advertising variables (e.g., 'TV + Newspaper ads,' 'TV + Radio ads,' 'TV + Radio + Newspaper ads') that could be used in a predictive model. The class then votes on which single or combined model they believe will be the best predictor for sales, setting the stage for empirical validation using Mean Squared Error later in Unit 4 Lesson 15."

    "title": "Introducing the Multi-Variable Predictive Equation in Unit 4 Lesson 15",
    "body": "A significant component of Unit 4 Lesson 15 involves the introduction and application of a specific linear regression equation designed to predict sales based on combined advertising expenditures: `sales = 0.044889(tv) + 0.194199(radio) - 0.007392(newspaper) + 3.154843`. This equation, generated using RStudio's `lm(Sales ~ TV + Radio + Newspaper, data= retail)` function, represents a model that combines 'TV,' 'Radio,' and 'Newspaper' advertising variables. Students are tasked with using this formula to predict sales for a particular market they had previously analyzed and circled in Unit 4 Lesson 14, referring to data from the *Advertising Plots Part 2* handout (LMR_U4_L14_B). A crucial instruction reminds students to input raw values (e.g., 10 for 10 thousand dollars). The predicted value of 10.81224 (representing 108,122 units) for an outlier market leads to a discussion on its plausibility, especially when actual sales were around 16,000 units, demonstrating that even combined models may not perfectly predict every data point, particularly outliers. This practical application reinforces the lesson's objective of understanding how information from multiple variables is combined."

    "title": "Understanding and Interpreting Mean Squared Error (MSE) in Unit 4 Lesson 15",
    "body": "In Unit 4 Lesson 15, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) is introduced as a critical metric for evaluating the accuracy and reliability of predictive models. MSE quantifies the average of the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual observed values, serving as a measure of the typical magnitude of a model's prediction error. The lesson clarifies that a smaller MSE indicates a more accurate and reliable predictive model. It is emphasized that MSE values are in 'square units,' and to convert this error back into the original units of the response variable (e.g., units sold), the square root of the MSE must be taken. For instance, an MSE of 11.38103 for the 'TV' model translates to predictions typically being off by approximately 3.373579 (in 10,000s) or 33,736 units. Understanding MSE is fundamental to comparing the performance of different single-variable and combined-variable models, directly addressing the objective of Unit 4 Lesson 15 to determine if including more variables leads to better predictions."

    "title": "Comparative Analysis of Model Performance with MSE in Unit 4 Lesson 15",
    "body": "Unit 4 Lesson 15 presents a detailed comparison of single and combined advertising models based on their Mean Squared Error (MSE) values to determine which configuration yields the best predictions. The results, calculated using RStudio, reveal that the 'TV-Radio' combined model achieved the lowest MSE of 4.456745, indicating it was the most accurate predictor, with predictions typically deviating by approximately 2.1111 (in 10,000s) or 21,111 units. Conversely, the 'Newspaper' single-variable model was identified as the least reliable, exhibiting the highest MSE of 31.44164, signifying an average prediction error of about 5.607285 (in 10,000s) or 56,073 units. A general observation from this analysis, central to Unit 4 Lesson 15, is that combining variables often leads to substantially better predictions than relying on single-variable models. This empirical evidence directly supports the essential concept that incorporating multiple predictors can significantly improve model accuracy, as measured by a reduced MSE."

    "title": "Revisiting Hypotheses and Future Learning in Unit 4 Lesson 15 and Unit 4 Lab 4F",
    "body": "Towards the end of Unit 4 Lesson 15, students are prompted to reconsider their initial hypotheses from Unit 4 Lesson 14 regarding whether combining variables improves or worsens predictions. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) data provides nuanced evidence: while the 'TV-Radio' model demonstrated superior performance over single-variable models, the 'TV-Radio-Newspaper' model, including all three variables, showed a slightly higher MSE than 'TV-Radio,' suggesting that simply adding more variables doesn't always guarantee the *absolute best* improvement. This fosters a discussion on the complexities of model selection and the evidence supporting the essential concept that more information *can* lead to better predictions. The lesson sets the stage for Unit 4 Lab 4F, where students will gain practical experience creating lines of best fit for models incorporating multiple variables. As homework, students are asked to reflect on why creating scatterplots for models with more than three predictor variables is problematic, highlighting the inherent human limitation in visualizing dimensions beyond three, which is crucial context for understanding higher-dimensional models in Unit 4 Lab 4F."
