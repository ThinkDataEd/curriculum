    "body": "Unit 4, Section 3, titled 'Piecing it Together,' is a 5-day instructional unit focused on introducing students to multiple regression models and polynomial transformations. The enduring understanding is that complex real-life phenomena can be explained and predicted using these statistical tools, adding flexibility to rigid linear models. Students will engage with an article about TV show spinoffs to build context for using multiple explanatory variables. Learning objectives span statistical/mathematical concepts like graphing equations and fitting functions to data, data science principles such as understanding the appropriateness of multiple vs. simple linear regression, and applied computational thinking using RStudio to implement these models. Real-world connections highlight the use of multiple regression by economists and marketing firms. Language objectives emphasize critical reading, discussion, and model construction. The unit utilizes existing data files (`data(movie)`, `data(cereal)`) and incorporates a team-generated participatory sensing campaign for data collection. This section aims to equip students with the skills to analyze and predict complex phenomena using advanced regression techniques."

    "body": "In 'Unit 4, Section 3: Piecing it Together,' students will develop key statistical and mathematical competencies over 5 instructional days. A primary objective, aligned with A-REI D-10, is to understand that the graph of an equation in two variables represents the complete set of its solutions when plotted in the coordinate plane. These graphs often form a curve, though they can also be a straight line. Furthermore, under S-ID 6, students will learn to represent data on two quantitative variables using a scatter plot and effectively describe the relationship observed between these variables. This includes fitting a function to the data and using the fitted functions to solve practical problems within the data's context. The curriculum emphasizes the use of given functions or selecting appropriate functions suggested by the context, with a particular focus on linear models as a foundational concept before moving to more complex regression techniques required for multiple explanatory variables."
