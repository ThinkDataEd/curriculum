    "body": "Unit 4 Lesson 19, titled 'Our Class Network,' guides students through an activity to map out their own social network based on acquaintances. The lesson's primary objective is for students to participate in creating a visualization of their network. Key materials include the *Friend Network Graphic* (LMR_U4_L19_A), index cards for data collection, and the *Network Code* file (LMR_U4_L19_B.R) for generating visualizations. The essential concept revolves around networks being formed when observations are interconnected, allowing the examination of relationships within a social setting. Students engage in a hands-on activity where they create index cards detailing connections between classmates and a shared third acquaintance. This raw data is then manually input by the teacher into a .csv spreadsheet, which is subsequently processed using provided R code to produce a visual representation of the class's social network. The R code requires specific teacher edits, such as updating the input filename and adjusting parameters to identify popular individuals. The lesson culminates with a 'Class Scribes' discussion and marks the end of Team Participatory Sensing data collection, transitioning students to the End of Unit 4 Project for data analysis."

    "title": "Introduction to Social Networks and Objectives of Unit 4 Lesson 19",
    "body": "Unit 4 Lesson 19, 'Our Class Network,' introduces students to the fundamental concept of networks. The primary objective is for students to actively participate in mapping their own social network, identifying acquaintances between two people. An essential concept highlighted is that networks are created when observations are interconnected, particularly in social settings where relationships between individuals can be examined. The lesson begins by displaying the *Friend Network Graphic* (LMR_U4_L19_A), a WolframAlpha visualization of Facebook friends, to illustrate what a network—a group of interconnected people or things—looks like. Through a guided Q&A, students explore what dots represent (people), lines represent (friendships), denser areas (more connections), and groupings (social circles). The vocabulary term 'network' is defined as 'a system designed to transfer data from one network access point to one other or more network access points via data switching, transmission lines, and system controls.' Students are also prompted to consider other social networks they belong to, such as TikTok, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and LinkedIn, before embarking on creating their own class network visualization."

    "title": "Materials and Core Network Concepts for Unit 4 Lesson 19",
    "body": "For Unit 4 Lesson 19, 'Our Class Network,' students will engage with specific materials to understand and map social networks. The required materials include the *Friend Network Graphic* (LMR_U4_L19_A), which serves as a visual example of a social network, index cards for collecting peer connection data, and the *Network Code* file (LMR_U4_L19_B.R), an R script designed to process data and generate network visualizations. The lesson reinforces the essential concept that networks emerge from interconnected observations, allowing for the analysis of relationships, especially within social contexts. The term 'network' is explicitly defined as 'a system designed to transfer data from one network access point to one other or more network access points via data switching, transmission lines, and system controls.' This lesson extends the understanding of networks from large-scale examples, like the Facebook friend visualization, to the idea that networks can be as small as a classroom, allowing for direct participation in creating and analyzing a localized social network. This hands-on approach helps students grasp how different people are connected through various relationships, setting the stage for data collection and visualization."

    "title": "The Unit 4 Lesson 19 Class Network Activity: Card Preparation",
    "body": "A core component of Unit 4 Lesson 19, 'Our Class Network,' is a hands-on activity designed for students to map their own class's social network. The objective is to understand how relationships can be visualized. The activity begins with the distribution of index cards; each student receives enough cards to establish a connection with every other person in the class. For instance, a class of 20 students would require each student to have 19 cards. On every index card, students must first write their full first and last name in the lower left-hand corner. Subsequently, they circulate around the classroom, interacting with classmates, and write another student’s first and last name in the top right-hand corner of an index card. The crucial step involves identifying a shared acquaintance: in the center of the card, students must write the name of the closest third person that *both* the student and the classmate on the card know. This third person can be anyone—a fellow student, someone outside the school, or even outside the class. This detailed card creation process, focused on identifying shared connections, forms the raw data for the subsequent network visualization, a process that is anticipated to take an entire class period due to the comprehensive nature of collecting connections between all peers."

    "title": "Mapping Connections in Unit 4 Lesson 19: Identifying Shared Acquaintances",
    "body": "The social network activity in Unit 4 Lesson 19, 'Our Class Network,' is central to achieving the lesson's objective of visualizing class connections. After students have prepared index cards by writing their own name and a classmate's name, the next critical step is to identify and record the 'closest 3rd person that they BOTH know' in the center of the card. This individual could be another classmate, someone from outside the school, or even someone not attending the same school, emphasizing that social connections extend beyond immediate environments. This process captures the interconnectedness that forms the basis of a network. Once all students have completed their cards, detailing their connections and shared acquaintances with every other person in the class, these cards are collected by the teacher. It is important to note that this comprehensive data collection phase, involving peer interaction and precise recording of relationships on multiple index cards, is expected to consume an entire class period. The collected cards serve as the raw data, which the teacher will then manually transcribe into a digital format for subsequent visualization, highlighting the transition from physical data collection to digital processing for network analysis."

    "title": "Data Digitization and Spreadsheet Preparation for Network Analysis in Unit 4 Lesson 19",
    "body": "Following the hands-on card-based network activity in Unit 4 Lesson 19, 'Our Class Network,' the next crucial phase involves the teacher manually digitizing the collected data. After students have submitted their index cards, each detailing a connection and a shared acquaintance, the teacher must meticulously input this information into a spreadsheet. It is strongly recommended to save this spreadsheet as a .csv (comma-separated values) file, as this format is easily readable by data analysis tools. For redundancy, the lesson provides a clear example: each individual index card, representing a connection between two students and their shared third acquaintance, will typically translate into two distinct rows of data within the spreadsheet. This structured input is vital for accurate processing. Given the volume of data from a full class, it is advised that the teacher undertake this data entry after class hours. This ensures that the generated network visualizations can be prepared and presented to students on the subsequent day, allowing for a smooth transition from data collection to analysis. The processed .csv file will then be utilized with the provided *Network Code* file (LMR_U4_L19_B.R) to generate the visual representation of the class's social network, fulfilling the lesson's objective of mapping class connections."

    "title": "Generating Visualizations with R Code in Unit 4 Lesson 19",
    "body": "In Unit 4 Lesson 19, 'Our Class Network,' after the manual input of index card data into a .csv spreadsheet, the next step is to use the provided *Network Code* file (LMR_U4_L19_B.R) to produce visual graphs of the class's social network. This R script is a critical tool for transforming raw relationship data into an understandable visualization. Teachers need to be aware of specific edits required within the R script to ensure its proper functioning. Firstly, the filename for the .csv data must be updated in Line 7 of the code to match the saved spreadsheet. Secondly, to identify and highlight the most connected individuals, teachers should carefully read the comments provided in Lines 91-96. These comments guide on how to locate the five most 'popular' people in the class's network. This may necessitate further adjustments to Lines 97 and 108 of the code, depending on the specific criteria for popularity. The ability to customize these parameters allows for deeper insights into the network structure. The ultimate goal of using this R code is to generate an interactive and informative visualization, which can then be displayed and discussed with students, effectively completing the lesson's objective of mapping and understanding their interconnected class network based on shared acquaintances."

    "body": "Unit 4 Lesson 19, 'Our Class Network,' serves as a pivotal point in the curriculum, culminating the hands-on data collection phase of the Team Participatory Sensing campaign and setting the stage for subsequent analysis. The lesson's objective, which involves students mapping out their network based on acquaintances, directly contributes to broader data literacy and an understanding of interconnected observations. Upon completing the network visualization using the *Network Code* file (LMR_U4_L19_B.R) and the data from the index cards, students will engage in a 'Class Scribes' activity. During this, one team will briefly discuss what they consider to be the three most important topics or insights gained from the day's lesson. This reflective practice encourages critical thinking and summarization of learned concepts. Crucially, the day after Unit 4 Lesson 19, students will officially conclude their Team Participatory Sensing campaign data collection. This transition marks the shift from gathering information to analyzing it, as they will immediately begin working on their data as part of the comprehensive End of Unit 4 Project. This contextualizes the network activity within a larger framework of data science, emphasizing the entire lifecycle from data generation to insightful analysis."
