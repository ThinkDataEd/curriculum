    "body": "Unit 4 Lesson 16: 'Football or Futbol?' introduces students to decision trees as a powerful tool for classifying people or objects into groups, particularly when dealing with non-linear data trends. The lesson begins with a compelling real-world example of a decision tree used to diagnose heart attack risk, demonstrating its superior accuracy compared to individual doctors' expertise. Key vocabulary like 'classify,' 'decision tree,' 'nodes,' and 'Classification and Regression Trees (CART)' are defined. Students engage in a hands-on activity where they classify professional athletes as either soccer or football players using two different decision trees. This activity vividly illustrates how minor adjustments to a decision tree's structure and questions can lead to significant changes in classification accuracy and misclassification rates. The lesson concludes with a discussion reflecting on the mechanics of decision trees and a homework assignment that reinforces the identification of tree components in real-world examples."

    "body": "In Unit 4 Lesson 16, titled 'Football or Futbol?', students will achieve a clear understanding of what decision trees are and how they serve as classification tools, grouping individuals or objects based on specific criteria. A core objective is for students to actively participate in an activity demonstrating how even slight modifications to a decision tree's structure can result in drastic changes, either improvements or reductions, in misclassification rates. This hands-on experience is supported by essential materials, including the 'Decision Tree for Heart Attack Risk' graphic (LMR_U4_L16_A), 'CART Activity Player Stats' (LMR_U4_L16_B), 'CART Activity Round 1 Questions' (LMR_U4_L16_C), and 'CART Activity Round 2 Questions' (LMR_U4_L16_D). It is important to note that LMR_U4_L16_B, C, and D require advanced preparation, specifically cutting out the cards, as detailed in step 8 of the lesson plan, to facilitate the interactive activity."

    "title": "Core Concepts and Vocabulary: Understanding Decision Trees and Classification",
    "body": "Unit 4 Lesson 16, 'Football or Futbol?', establishes foundational knowledge for understanding decision trees. The essential concept highlighted is that not all trends are linear, meaning previous linear modeling approaches are insufficient for certain data types. Decision trees are introduced as a crucial non-linear tool specifically designed for classifying observations into distinct groups when data trends exhibit non-linear patterns. Key vocabulary includes 'classify,' which is the process of identifying the category an observation belongs to; a 'decision tree,' defined as a decision support tool employing a tree-like model of decisions and their potential consequences; 'Classification and Regression Trees (CART),' an overarching term for predictive algorithms used in machine learning to explain how a target variable's values can be predicted; and 'nodes,' representing points of intersection or connection within the data communication network, which in a decision tree signify questions or decision points. These terms are fundamental to grasping how decision trees function in classification tasks, a primary objective of Unit 4 Lesson 16."

    "title": "Introducing Decision Trees with the Heart Attack Risk Example in Unit 4 Lesson 16",
    "body": "Unit 4 Lesson 16, 'Football or Futbol?', begins by engaging students with a thought-provoking question: whom would they trust more for a chest pain diagnosis—a data scientist or a doctor? This sets the stage for introducing the real-world application of decision trees. Students learn about Lee Goldman, a cardiologist and early data scientist in the late 1970s, who developed a decision tree to diagnose heart attacks. This historical example showcases the remarkable accuracy of decision trees, with Goldman's model achieving over 95% correct diagnoses, significantly surpassing the 75-90% accuracy range of individual doctors. The lesson then displays a graphic similar to Goldman's decision tree, LMR_U4_L16_A ('Decision Tree for Heart Attack Risk'), prompting students to discuss in a Pair-Share activity what decision trees are and how they classify data. This introduction establishes decision trees as effective non-linear tools for classifying observations into groups, particularly beneficial when linear models are inadequate for complex, real-world data."

    "title": "Decision Tree Mechanics: Algorithms, Sequential Questions, and Nodes in Unit 4 Lesson 16",
    "body": "Unit 4 Lesson 16, 'Football or Futbol?', delves into the fundamental mechanics of decision trees. It explains that decision trees are 'grown' through the use of sophisticated algorithms—sets of rules that test numerous potential trees to identify the one that yields the most accurate predictions. Essentially, a decision tree functions as a series of sequential questions. Observations begin at the 'root node' (the initial question), then navigate along different 'branches' based on their answers, eventually leading to a classification as one of 'k' possible groups. Algorithms are crucial here, as they represent repeated steps allowing for the exploration of many possible paths from a single starting point, or the discovery of new starting points based on previous iterations. The concept of 'nodes' is further clarified: a 'root node' initiates the split of the dataset, 'internal nodes' continue to split the data based on subsequent questions, and 'leaf nodes' represent the final classification where no further splitting occurs. This detailed understanding of how decision trees are constructed and operate is vital for the hands-on activity in Unit 4 Lesson 16, where students will classify athletes."

    "title": "Introduction to Classification and Regression Trees (CART) Activity in Unit 4 Lesson 16",
    "body": "Unit 4 Lesson 16, 'Football or Futbol?', transitions from theoretical concepts to a practical application with the introduction of Classification and Regression Trees (CART). CART is presented as an umbrella term encompassing various types of decision trees, including 'Classification Trees' (which predict categorical variables, like 'soccer player' or 'football player') and 'Regression Trees' (which predict numerical values). To provide a tangible understanding of how decision trees work, students participate in an activity to classify 15 professional athletes into one of two groups: soccer players from the US Men's National Team or football players from the National Football League (NFL). This activity requires advanced preparation, specifically cutting out cards from LMR_U4_L16_B ('CART Activity Player Stats'), LMR_U4_L16_C ('CART Activity Round 1 Questions'), and LMR_U4_L16_D ('CART Activity Round 2 Questions'). Fifteen student volunteers act as 'players,' each receiving a data card with athlete statistics, while seven additional volunteers serve as the 'nodes' of the classification tree, asking questions based on the provided LMRs, highlighting the structural components of a decision tree (root, internal, and leaf nodes)."

    "title": "Executing the CART Activity: Round 1 Classification and Initial Results in Unit 4 Lesson 16",
    "body": "In Unit 4 Lesson 16, 'Football or Futbol?', the core learning experience is the interactive CART activity. After the preparation of materials (LMR_U4_L16_B, C, D cards), 15 student volunteers, designated as 'players,' each receive a unique data card from LMR_U4_L16_B detailing an athlete's team location, name, age, height, weight, and league. Seven additional student volunteers are assigned as 'nodes' of the classification tree, with each receiving a question or classification card from LMR_U4_L16_C. These nodes are strategically arranged in the classroom to represent the tree's structure: a 'root node' for the initial question, 'internal nodes' for subsequent decisions, and 'leaf nodes' for final classification. Each 'player' navigates the tree, answering 'yes' or 'no' to sequential questions posed by the nodes. This process continues until a 'leaf node' classifies the player as either a soccer or football athlete. Following Round 1, the classifications are recorded, and students discuss the initial success rate. For instance, if all player stats cards are used, approximately 6 out of 15 players (40%) might be classified correctly, resulting in a 60% 'misclassification rate,' a concept to be further explored in the next lesson. This initial round vividly demonstrates how decision trees classify by following a series of questions."

    "title": "Improving Classification Accuracy: CART Activity Round 2 and Misclassification Rate in Unit 4 Lesson 16",
    "body": "Unit 4 Lesson 16, 'Football or Futbol?', continues the CART activity by demonstrating the critical impact of decision tree structure on classification accuracy. Following Round 1, an additional five student volunteers are introduced as new 'nodes,' receiving questions from LMR_U4_L16_D ('CART Activity Round 2 Questions'). These new nodes are arranged to create an updated, potentially more refined decision tree. Each 'player' then proceeds through this new set of nodes, undergoing re-classification based on the revised rules. Just as in Round 1, the classifications from this second round are meticulously recorded. A key outcome of this exercise is the observable improvement in classification success. For example, if all player stats cards were used, Round 2 might yield 13 out of 15 players (87%) classified correctly, a substantial increase from Round 1. This significant improvement highlights how modifications to the decision tree's questions and order can drastically reduce the 'misclassification rate' (MCR), which is the proportion of incorrectly classified observations (e.g., 13% in Round 2 compared to 60% in Round 1). This practical comparison reinforces the lesson's objective: understanding how changes to a decision tree can lead to dramatic rises or reductions in misclassifications."

    "title": "Concluding Discussion and Homework: Consolidating Decision Tree Knowledge in Unit 4 Lesson 16",
    "body": "Upon completing the hands-on CART activity in Unit 4 Lesson 16, 'Football or Futbol?', students engage in a crucial post-activity discussion to consolidate their understanding of decision trees. Key questions include: 'How do decision trees classify objects/people as being a member of a group?' (Answer: By asking a series of questions sequentially, guiding participants along a specific path until classification occurs). Students also reflect on the comparative success of Round 2 versus Round 1, acknowledging the improved accuracy (e.g., 87% correct in Round 2 vs. 40% in Round 1) and the reduced misclassification rate. A more advanced question, 'How can we figure out what questions to ask and in what order to minimize the number of incorrect classifications?', encourages critical thinking about decision tree optimization. To further solidify learning, the lesson concludes with a 'Class Scribes' activity, where a team summarizes the day's three most important topics. For homework, students are tasked with finding an online decision tree relevant to their interests, identifying its 'nodes' (root, internal, and leaf), describing the population it applies to, and explaining what the tree predicts or classifies at its 'leaves.' This assignment ensures students can apply their newly acquired knowledge of decision tree structure and function to external examples."
