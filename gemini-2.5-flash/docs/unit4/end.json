    "title": "Contextual Foundation: Prior Learning for the Unit 4 Community Issue Project",
    "body": "The 'End of Unit 4 Project: Modeling a Community Issue' builds directly upon students' previous learning and practical experiences within Unit 4. Earlier in Unit 4, students gained valuable insights by exploring and analyzing data derived from two distinct sources: the 'Trash Participatory Sensing campaign' and public data from drought.gov, specifically related to U.S. drought conditions. A cornerstone of their preparation for this end-of-unit project was the creation of their *own* 'Participatory Sensing campaign'. This earlier campaign allowed students to investigate a self-selected issue within their community firsthand, collecting and initially analyzing relevant data. The current project now tasks students with utilizing the results and insights gained from their personalized 'Participatory Sensing campaign', potentially integrating official datasets, to address the specific research question formulated at the start of Unit 4, thereby applying their learned data analysis and modeling skills in a comprehensive manner."

    "title": "Core Assignment Steps: Researching Government Entities and Developing Recommendations",
    "body": "A fundamental component of the 'End of Unit 4 Project: Modeling a Community Issue' involves two critical initial steps. Firstly, students are required to conduct thorough research to identify the specific government entity—whether local, state, federal, or even an international entity—that holds responsibility for the particular community issue their team has chosen to investigate. This research ensures that proposed solutions are targeted at the appropriate stakeholders for maximum impact. Secondly, based on their understanding of the issue and the identified responsible entity, teams must formulate and propose one or two concrete recommendations. These recommendations are designed to either enhance public awareness surrounding the community issue or directly contribute to its alleviation. This process demands a deep understanding of the problem and a strategic approach to suggest actionable solutions that can be presented to the identified governmental body, supported by data from their Participatory Sensing campaign and other sources."
