    "title": "Understanding Pollution through Data: The Fighting Plastic Pollution Video",
    "body": "In Unit 4 Lesson 1: Trash, students initiate their exploration of trash issues by watching the video *Fighting Pollution Through Data*, available at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOYAIXjHveA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOYAIXjHveA). This video is a central component for introducing the problem and showcasing how data can be utilized to combat pollution. Students are instructed to apply the '5 Ws' strategy (What, Who, Why, When, Where) while viewing the first 10 minutes of the 13-minute video, documenting their observations in their DS journals. Following the video, a class discussion is facilitated to deepen understanding. Key discussion points revolve around the types of data collected in the video, such as photos, location, brand names, weight (kg), waste categories (e.g., plastic bags, straws, toothpaste), and packaging numbers. The discussion also addresses how these data points are useful in fighting plastic pollution, highlighting their role in brand accountability, community involvement, cleaning efforts, and identifying pollution sources. This exercise sets the stage for later data exploration activities related to the 'Trash Campaign'."

    "title": "Introducing the LAUSD Trash Campaign: A Participatory Sensing Initiative",
    "body": "Unit 4 Lesson 1: Trash introduces students to a significant local initiative: the 'Trash Campaign.' This Participatory Sensing campaign was conceptualized and executed by concerned students within the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD). These students engaged in a model eliciting activity to design the campaign, aiming to investigate potential trash-related issues prevalent in their communities. The data gathered through this extensive campaign became the foundation for formulating recommendations presented to the Los Angeles County Sanitation District (LACSD). The ultimate goal of these recommendations was to contribute to the reduction of reliance on regional landfills. This hands-on, real-world example demonstrates the practical application of data collection and analysis in addressing environmental challenges. Students will interact with the data from this campaign through the IDS public dashboard and the *Trash Campaign Exploration* handout (LMR_U4_L1_B) to understand its structure and findings, reinforcing the lesson's objective of reducing landfill burden. This campaign exemplifies how human sensors can collect valuable data for community problem-solving."

    "title": "Exploring the Trash Campaign Data Dashboard",
    "body": "In Unit 4 Lesson 1: Trash, a significant portion of the lesson involves students actively exploring data from the 'Trash Campaign' via the IDS public dashboard, located at [https://portal.thinkdataed.org](https://portal.thinkdataed.org). Students are guided to select the 'Trash' campaign and access its 'Dashboard' through the 'Action' button. The dashboard serves as a visual and interactive tool, allowing students to analyze the collected Participatory Sensing data. To facilitate this exploration, the *Trash Campaign Exploration* handout (LMR_U4_L1_B) is distributed, providing a structured set of questions to guide their investigation. This activity reinforces the essential concept that exploring different datasets yields insights into processes, even while acknowledging the limitations of human-sensed data for broader generalization. Students learn to interpret various data characteristics by 'playing' with the dashboard, preparing them for detailed analysis and understanding of the campaign's findings regarding trash generation and disposal patterns and how these insights can help reduce the burden of trash landfills."

    "title": "Key Findings and Data Analysis from the Trash Campaign Dashboard",
    "body": "Unit 4 Lesson 1: Trash guides students through an in-depth analysis of the 'Trash Campaign' data, accessible via the IDS public dashboard. Using the *Trash Campaign Exploration* handout (LMR_U4_L1_B), students answer specific questions to uncover key insights. The dataset comprises 2,631 observations, with the majority of trash (1,254 observations) generated at school, significantly more than at work (59). Recyclable materials (1,302) or paper (477) were identified as the most commonly discarded items. At home, the largest percentage of trash (106 observations) was generated between 9 PM and 10 PM (2100 and 2200). Eating/cooking activities contributed the largest percentage of landfill-destined trash, accounting for 69.02% (822 out of 1,191 items). Drinking was found more likely to generate recyclable trash (480 recyclables) than eating (399 recyclables), out of a total of 1,302 recyclables. These findings offer concrete examples of how data from a Participatory Sensing campaign can inform strategies for reducing landfill burden."

    "title": "Deep Dive into the Trash Campaign's Impact and Data Nuances",
    "body": "The 'Trash Campaign,' a Participatory Sensing initiative explored in Unit 4 Lesson 1: Trash, provides critical data points for students to understand waste management challenges and potential solutions for reducing landfill burden. Beyond general statistics from the IDS public dashboard, the campaign reveals nuanced behaviors. For instance, despite the presence of recycle bins, 26.6% (225 out of 846) of recyclable items still ended up in trash bins. This misdirection was more pronounced at school (134 out of 225 instances) compared to home (76 out of 225 instances), suggesting different contextual factors influencing recycling behavior in various environments. The data also highlighted that 15 out of 58 instances of littering occurred when the person was not near any type of waste receptacle. This level of detail, derived from the LAUSD students' campaign, directly informs strategies to reduce the use of regional landfills, aligning with the lesson's primary objective and showcasing the value of human-sensed data in identifying specific problem areas."
